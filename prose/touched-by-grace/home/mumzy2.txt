How can I forget that night - when I saw the three kittens playing?
It was one of those nights that I enjoyed so much, my face lights up.
Imu was with me and we shared the joy together - those kittens in
our verandah for two whole days - then mama cat took them to a safer home.

You see a tom cat came and was causing trouble for the poor babies...
It was unfortunate that we couldnt enjoy more days like those.
My son asks me why we couldnt just take them inside and keep them?
I carry the guilt that I couldnt give my son the thrill of having pets,

But I never liked pets all over the house - silly though it may seem.
He says not to worry, to make my peace with it now - no need for guilt.
Another thing I cannot forget that also gave me great joy - was Inara
and my Mother playing with the peas one night in the hall. Just the sight!

Many are the memories long forgot - I remember my father coming home nights
My son too remembers my husband and the thrill of being a full house -
Alive and joyous to behold. With young children erupting in peals of laughter.
Me and my siblings... My children... and lastly, my granddaughter.

Come now my friend, life is a magnificent thing to behold - GO LIVE IT
Why have you forsaken me - my love, my life - are we to meet again?
On shores long unseen, paths not oft walked. Thank you for being mine.
And all the little things you did for me. God bless and godspeed (me to you).
