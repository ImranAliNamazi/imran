To THEE who hast been the material envelope of Our Master. That Master who abides deep in our heart, whose smile can light up and set at peace a despairing soul - whose very memory can make all the toils and struggles of yesteryear seem worth the effort and wash away the seeming cost - whose countenance and temper make life again worth living.

To SHE, that incarnate of the four Shaktis - who causes the buds and leaves of our heart to blossom and rekindles life - i the seeming inertness of it's autumn.
