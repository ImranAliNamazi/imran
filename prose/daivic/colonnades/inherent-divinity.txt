# Personal History of Imran and his FOREFATHERS

I have 3 forefathers viz. Sivaraman, Ismail and Shayesteh... They were all **NOBLE SOULS THAT REVERED EVERYTHING**...

They STOOD for the LOVE and LIGHT of their time - WHO WILL STAND FOR OUR's?

> Religion Devolves | Sacrifice Evolves

So, if you really want to evolve - what comforts and bigotry would you sacrifice? In which **TEMPLE, MASJID or CHURCH** do you really see purity of INTENTION?

How many SHARIRAS or SHEATHS of your body would you discard truly to see the **WORKER CLASS BEING UPLIFTED**? Would You:

1. Shed Inhibitions.
2. End Conformity.
3. End Sterility.
4. Stop Committing the Cardinal Sins (in any form whatsoever).
5. Set People FREE from the PRISONS that CHAIN.
6. Get away from INSTITITIONS that would CONFINE with their DOGMA and BIGOTRY.
7. Help Move Humanity away from CAPITALISM, CASTE, CREED, CLASS etc
8. Invoke the **SPIRIT of the BRAHMANA (wise man) AND KSHATRIYA (warrior / leader)**, PREPARE TO LITERALLY SHED BLOOD, lessen the voice of the VAISHYA (trader) and **TRULY UPLIFT THE WORKING CLASS** - those with fewer and fewer options, whose children have virtually NO FUTURE in the CONCRETE JUNGLE!

Like [SATPREM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satprem) said, everything is collapsing since we are on the verge of BECOMING SOMETHING NEW.

HUMANITY!!! The time has come for the last [renaissance that will truly leave us](https://imran.yieldmore.org/the-neverending-story/) empowered, uplifted and united.
