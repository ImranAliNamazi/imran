# Act Now - Sep 12

Act NOW my lads and lassies, for we, the flowers that bloom today in Nature's Garden, tomorrow may be dying*.

Set out boldly to uncover life's secrets, walk her well beaten paths and hidden ways. Walk alone if you like, but from your loneliness, let all its solitary contemplation lead you to find a well of love so then may you seek companions with which to share the nectar of that well.

In our combined well being alone shall we truly find our happiness*, so let go of the past and it's hurts.

Yesterday, when I was mad* I forgot my humble place, said unkind words to my family, neglected my friends and saw the world as dreary.

Now I cry for lost time, for I realize my folly and wish to, with every waking moment, do justice to the **gift of life**.

I leave you to slam up against your own walls*, and hew your paths* as we strive to find the true meaning of our lives.

# Satsang In a Circle.

Just as within an acorn lies the power of a tree and even a forest, so too in each of us is the latent power of divinity and willed ascension.

If in the religion that is to exist in the future, each man and woman will have to salvage for himself in his own time and manner, then why not embark on a new phase of our COMBINED journey - one of Shanti or Peace, Vidya or Learning, Vivekam or Right Discrimination and Prem or Love.

Not to mention Karma or Action, Bhakti or Devotion, Dhyana or Giving and Seva or Service.

If above all, as is writ, Satyameva Jayathe - Truth Alone Triumphs, then when we join together for Satsang or Spiritual Discourse, why not, in a spirit of recognising and encouraging that Divine Spark in everyone, we allow EACH to say their piece with absolute acceptance that all are valid viewpoints and that we cannot order things in their lives how we please.

Those thoughts are alien to other's individual and unique journeys and all paths ultimately lead every last spec of consciousness into the Divine Bath of Superconsciousness, so we need to weave a tapestry of love and compassion around ourselves that keeps radiating further as our horizons expand.

# Being Heard

Alabama?

Each of us is given a crazy portion of life to understand, and like a toddler learning to count, suddenly exposed to the beauty of fractals, our minds boggle at the digestion of the meaning of it all.

Ever since the first Cro Magnon looked up at the stars in the heavens, he wondered if there was a Creator who had fashioned it all.

There is a running commentary in our heads like a newsreader being broadcast live. We crave the company of others, because my friends, Maslow had it all wrong, humanity has only one need, the need to be heard!

And feel that our understanding of life unfolding is validated and vindicated?? by our listener.

When we are peacefully heard, a talent more so of the listener who has much Shanti and Tejas about him, we feel accepted and loved.

So crave on my fellow creatures, seek constantly to share your wisdom as you acquire more, then look up to the Heavens and beg for the grace of those primal forces and vibrations of the cosmos that hold the stars in their hands.

# Do lunatics make good warriors?

It has been a hard adult life with multiple episodes of looneyness interspersed by acute bouts of darkness and anger.

We each have our own obstacle course to run, and a lifetime of trying as we slam up against our own walls or get derailed by our fellow global citizens.

Perhaps barbarians we still are, blatantly denying our own Gods who command us to love one another. Where is that oneness of humanity? But, Armageddon and Pralaya are not yet here, and there is still hope that the good deeds of the few may still weigh strongly against the misdeeds of the many.

There have always been pockets of hope, where truly the battle to win the Kingdom of Heaven is still being waged, so rally to your nearest truly Dharmic leader and let not the dark forces gain another micrometre, today or forever more.

Make yourselves hardy yet soft and pliable, don't let differences trip you up, and above all, learn the ways of gentleness, kindness and to radiate love.

# Dolts and Dunderheads

Though I still am one, I still am self aware enough to realise that we have much to endeavour and strive if we are to apply the wisdom of books and stories to our inner development and to those beings and things around us.

We fall into routines and patterns and have such a strong need to conform with the masses that most of us keep walking like lemurs and automatons from one mindless activity to another.

Where is the dedication and application of ourselves to the discovery and celebration of the human spirit? The bold adventurer, the noble statesman, the dedicated professional, the effervescent storyteller, the disruptive forerunner or the fearless inventor or the artist who dips his brushes in magic waters?

Where is heard the echo of the songs that speak of one world? Or are we forever to sit in our towers of Babel and prejudice and let the politicians muddy everything? Which devisive beliefs and propaganda are we lending our ears to and how much more rape will we allow by those who abuse power to propagate hate before we decide we've had enough.

Humanity, wake up, this Earth is DYING on so many fronts, find a hundred causes and stop sleeping. Together we can stem the bleed and birth a new future.

# Life, Time and their Imports

In all of creation and the constant eddies of life giving of and to itself, there are two things of utmost importance:

1) The stories we allow others to express that we may someday weave into the fabric of our own stories unfolding.

THIS MEANS

Listen actively with compassion and answer with insightful wisdom for our very collective future depends on it.

2) The dreams of our Forefathers, Elders and Children.

We unfortunately are so dumbed and numbed with our fascination for the happenings in the Concrete Jungle and the Mainstage Cesspool of politicians, media, corporations and those who would establish and prolong the rule of decadence, that we have not the daringness to dream.

We can however remember the lives of our Forefathers, the Dreams of our Elders and waken from the delusion of worldly pursuits and strive most earnestly and jointly to create a future world more inhabitable by our children.

THIS MEANS

We are RUNNING OUT OF TIME, so hitchhike to all to unknown K-Pax or Fantasia to see the harmony in the starlit heavens, then quickly come back to Earth and SLAY THE DRAGON and SAVE FINDUILAS before IT'S TOO LATE.

Don't let the tragedy of the Children of Hurin Thalion overtake you and be utterly defeated, for though we set out to conquer time and our dooms, sometimes we may find ourselves utterly defeated.

# Beings of Light - Yagnashala!

All the Matter and Dark Matter which is the Dust or Sraf of the Universe would swirl in large gaseous clouds and slowly bond, coalesce and congeal until its inner integrity grew so strong that it near solidified into a HUGE BALL.

Then, the Universal Shakti, or perhaps Zeus himself would hurl a FLAMING TORCH at it and it would LIGHT UP LIKE A BEACON of Shining Hope.

The temperature at its Kernel, known to some as the Anandamayakosha, that powers Agni herself goes to excesses of 15 million Celsius.

Scarcely outside the surface of this Celestial Sun, the temperature dips to a lowly 2 million degrees Celsius. An even more dazzling fireworks display is enacted on the backdrop of this 4.5 Billion year old glowing orb as Rishis re-enter seeking refuge and replenishment, and Newly Reforged Souls exit to Hitchhike the Galaxy.

The entry and exit through the membrane of a Sun is marked by a solar flare, dazzling to watch as our satellites photograph it all from the 2nd orbit, daring to go yet closer as we penetrator the sheaths.

All of us here, on this Third Rock From The Sun are but motes of that stardust and can shine in an effervescent twinkling collective dance, ONLY if we do the Yoga and Tapas of Penance, setting our very bodies to burn as offering to that highest God of Abraham, Holy Father, Yahweh, Allah or Purushottama - The Eternal Brahman!

The Formula to that Body Burning, is enacted in our daily oblations, offerings, strivings, even Manathri or Mind Burning penances and is enshrined in the Red Indian Chants, the French Cathars way of life, The Aboriginal and African Peoples, always did the Mongoloids have it, preserving it like the Old Indic Peoples.

It was dusted off from the altars in the Synagogues when Jesus dared to speak its language and Many Burned for daring to gift an English Bible in Latin Dominated England.

It's FLAG or FLAGS are battered and old, yet still fly high under which are heard the Lord's Prayer, the Buddhist Chants, the Surah al Hamd and even the Gayatri Mantra.

It matters not what is to become the next Lingua France as long as we heed the warnings and meditate on the imports from the story of the Tower of Babel.

All civilizations of this world show the utmost kindness and consideration, enduring even privations to make the guest or newcomes feel at HOME. That's common human decency.

In all of this, come back for a minute and just realise the Herculean task that Nature undertakes which constantly moulds each of us into the Image of God.

That Sanction, Indulgence and ABSOLUTE protection and freedom of our Lord, not to mention the loving endurance and embrace of our Forefathers and Foremothers the ture Devas and Devis of our Universe is THE YOGA that will one day make us ALL Beings of Light.

# Charging Hell with a Bucket

Dear Ali,

In my madness I never forgot the message of love the prophets bore..But my anger was missing and was unchained by a friend the week before I came to the forests... Now I'm this raging inferno, my military is ready and my war has begun. To demolish all untruths and unsacrifices, I see your hatred for misapplied religion and spirituality coz I've seen its dregs and war mongery for 10 days the last 5 of which I've worked enraged for the intention of the souls with the right spirit, I've built my endurance to serve them and barked at every clown and control freak in my mind in the whole of this planet and her history whole defile their Inner Temples and spoil their sacrifice...

I go now like a newly reforged soul to empower the serfs and servants and exploited masses at the lowest of the pyramid, the cannon fodder for our modern @#&$% @#$$! capitalism. I go enraged. I took so much spirit and heart from them. My father stood for the orphans of his father's adoption, year after year, student after student.

Now I stand for the oppressed and exploited and disenfranchised. Rob from the rich and empower those with lesser and lesser options who are the downtrodden. The clues have been scattered all through my past bit ooh I wanted to be an artist. Another friend was right that this rich royalty and bourgeois are not the ones that need to be heard, they're just regurgitated intellectual masturbation sanctioned by the authorities to propagate desecration on the spirit of the working class... I will use their souls and transform them into the next generation of healers, teachers amd artists... putting these pseudo intellectuals with no heart or thought for service in their true place. My next life's mission begins, I HAVE become now the Thracian plotting his way out of the gladiator school.

# Tigers In Space
For:
* Hurin Thalion who wielded an axe at last, two handed when hope was ALMOST GONE, but whose spirit could never be conquered.
* Lt General Chuck Horner, embittered in the betrayals of truth, tortured by the Wall of Deceit, but whose spirit rose from the hells of Vietnam, went on to rouse every tiger wounded or in stupor, and who with love, finally send warriors and emissaries to COMMAND SPACE. Outer Space or Inner Space we never shall know.
* Little Taminder Ferret who rose high, became a giant, then caught a light beam, becoming SO VERY BRIGHT, just like Chiang Did, some Generations Before. And to the LITTLE FERRET Budgie that Once LOOKED TO THE STARS AND PICKED ___ (NOT MUSTELA) trusting that a new FORCE HAD BEEN AWAKENED IN HIM.

FOR EACH OF THEM HAD A STORY, WHOSE ECHOES STILL THRILL THE GODS AS THEY VISIT EARTH TO HEAR THEM REFLECTED ANEW IN OUR LIVES AND LESSER STORIES.

It's a Wicked Game we play, and to the millions perhaps even billions of warriors dead andd gone, but not forgotten, with the Cry of the Lion King, we look to the stars and hear their legacy:

* Strive as the Missisippi did in ages past when she delved the Grand Canyon. Learn to train every Siddhi or Superpower, STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS and GIVE YOUR ALL.
* Give everything AND MORE then absorb the grace that shines from the Mountain Taniquetil or the Flame Imperishable at the Center of the Universe (The Vishnunabhi) and turn every lost battle or anguish into a DREAD FORCE THAT CONSUMES YOU WITH LOVE.
* Love as only those beings healed of hurt and torment can.
* Purify as our Rishis and Gurus would IMPLORE US.
* Break as each RANK of your COMRADES Crashes Upon the Shore
* Rebuild as Prophet Elijah did at Akbar.
* Break Away from ANY AND ALL SHACKLED and delight as the bird soaring high in the SKY - the Eagles of MANWE and the Lesser Birds that befriended RADAGAST
