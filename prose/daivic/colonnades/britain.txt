Dearest Shashi Tharoor,

I understand your passionate fervour to bring Enland to it's knees in a sense, to ask for forgiveness for the atrocities committed in the past centuries.

I would recall to your mind, my unshakeable faith in the Divine Plan unfolding, and ask you to temper your speech with compassion after pondering the following.

I ask this, for though the words were well intentioned, it has created an urge to hit back.

1. All is the Lila of the Absolute Parabrahman.
2. We delight in loving and forgiving one another - that is our natural and exalted state.
3. Moral and Social Evolution happens through pained experience, one by one and from one to a few who would listen.
4. Compassion cannot be mass produced. As we found guile and malice over the millennia, so too unlearning it requires tremendous love an patience from our Seers and Seeresses.
5. What if those Britons are the ones serving in India and have incarnated throughout the commonwealth to both serve and to suffer. We must bless them to release each other from the bondage of Karma.
