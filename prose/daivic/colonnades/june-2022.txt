# The Adventure of Superconsciousness

I'm neither an adventurer nor accomplished in the study of superconsciousness. It's just a fancy title to tickle the writer's mind. A friend mentioned this book a couple of years ago, and I'm currently wondering what that could mean for humanity.

# Embrace the Times

> Nature constantly moulds us into the Image of God

Sri Yukteshwar contends that the dark ages began to end 120 years before 1700. I too am convinced that we are living a new age of illumination. Need I say more!

In 2015, I wrote [what I lovingly call the YM charter]([url]charter/), which spoke of some monumentous work ahead for humankind, a certainty of a Divine Manifestation on Earth. It reads

"Alla and Shasa were entrusted with the mission of reinstating the old way of life among the humans. They had the love and support of countless lightworkers of both civilizations to build upon. The last four years of madness had seen the humans pushed to the brink of total annhilation, but the seeds of all the Bright Ones and the thousand loving movements had all borne fruit."

# Holding Hands (and) Building Bridges

[@medium](https://medium.com/@imran_ym/holding-hands-and-building-bridges-d53e74e35c8a)

Today I spent an hour repairing some worn out bridges - a simple evening with mumzy, expressing our feelings and past hurts.

I aim to do this more often as my father's 3rd anniversary approaches. For the gentle giant that he was.

I had told a friend a few days ago that perhaps I should spent more time with her, writing together.

And here is what we had to say.

It was a warm cozy evening with nary a silly word from me. Felt good, like I was finally home, and had been touched by grace - my mother's of course!

# Bounded - 24 Jun

In the game of life, we are BOUNDED to one another. This means that when you are in a bind, I will drop everything and do my utmost for you.

At least, I would like to one day DO that for someone for all the friends who've stood by me to this day.

Love &lt;3 is a treasure above any other. One we often misplace in our very search for it.

And then I met a fellow with a motto to "Always Love" and guffawed what does this mean? I do indeed always love! 3 years later I realize I've just been fooling myself - love isn't just a passing emotion - it's an ACTION, sometimes a decisive action sanctioned by the Divine Mother herself.

So, once again I set out to "wow the world" with my perpetual acting with love. (Read as make a few clickety clacks on a keyboard).

Seriously, I hope we world denizens can continually show a more embracing view as we learn to communicate non violently and strive for peace - utter and permanent.

You see, we've been bounded together since the beginning of time.

And that's what it's all about!

All love to the world family!

# Divinize The Music

> I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride&hellip; And something touched me deep inside, the day, the music, died!

Sang Don McLean some 50 years ago when Buddy Holly died&hellip; And here I am talking about it in 2022&hellip; If music is Divine, how can it die? Or does he mean that the soulstuff that makes up good music can die, undergo a metamorphosis, and be reborn too?

When we die, does our music die with us or does it live on, to be heard anew, and felt and for strains of it to become NEW music?

There is nothing more divine than music. A singing to the soul.

I hear the drizzle of the rain, like a memory it falls, soft and warm continuing, tapping on my roof and walls.

I realized some years ago that most of the songs we hear are flawed in words. They speak of lost love, abominations unto one another, how we have failed, are about to fail, how we're plagued by this and that.

If reality is a projection of the mind then mustn't we guard against a pollution of the thoughts that occupy and exercise it? Be especially careful of what we let our subconscious dwell upon.

> All my love, came to nothing at all, when I woke up to find, you were no longer mine!!

Can't we instead say&hellip;

> All my love, becomes everything at your touch. And I keep waking up to find that I love you so much!!

Go now! Love someone, embrace them with a gentle touch - that's much&hellip;

# Stand for Something Good

[@medium](https://medium.com/@imran_ym/stand-for-something-good-e2d2ecc917e3)

Did you know World War III is about to begin and we are all doomed? Well doomed inasmuch as we don't do or do the works we set upon for ourselves in this world.

A Sadhak reflected thus on a sustained experience of Lord Krishna:
Then He placed the Gita in my hands. His strength entered into me and I was able to do the sadhana of the Gita. I was not only to understand intellectually but to realise what Sri Krishna demanded of Arjuna and what He demands of those who aspire to do His work, to be free from repulsion and desire, to do work for Him without the demand for fruit, to renounce self-will and become a passive and faithful instrument in His hands, to have an equal heart for high and low, friend and opponent, success and failure, yet not to do His work negligently.

The last line of this paragraph has been haunting me of late&hellip; Are we doing our works dejectedly? Dispassionately? Mechanistically? Negligently?

Mea Culpa! At 38, is that light I thought I had scarce 5 years ago already failing? Have I let myself get entangled in the woes of my personal world and forgot the cries of the world at large.

Have I failed to keep the lamp trimmed and are the ears shut to the call of Lord Hrishikesha? My Lord, my Liege! This too we were warned against:

Unhappy is the man or the nation which, when the divine moment arrives, is found sleeping or unprepared to use it, because the lamp has not been kept trimmed for the welcome and the ears are sealed to the call. But thrice woe to them who are strong and ready, yet waste the force or misuse the moment; for them is irreparable loss or a great destruction.

What Divine moment is spoken of when all we see is hatred and the seeds of utter destruction? Destruction in Dwapara 322 when we should be seeing bursts of spontaneous love?

Love? In 2022? When all the doomsdayers can say is that our imminent destruction is at hand? An Armageddon or a Pralaya. Not This! Not This!

Krishna, Buddha, Christ and Muhammed came to AVERT that destruction that seemed nigh, guide us with love OUT of the Dark Ages, guide us with love INTO the light. But our eyes hurt from that love so much, that we stand naked in the sunlight, shut our eyes tight and beg a way out of this darkness.

All we have to do is believe in the memory and the promise of that love. The world at large may not turn perfect in that instant, but our INNER WORLD can, the world we give all our nurturing and attention to.

Lord, let not another day go by when we stand disoriented in the bright, divine light, crying in the memory of past darkness.

Let us unite with our brothers and sisters and STAND for something good, anything we are wont to stand for.

Jagat Kula Ki Prem

All love to the world family!
