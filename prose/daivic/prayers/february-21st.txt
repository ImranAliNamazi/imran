James Allen Thought and Meditation...

<h3>Thought for the Morning</h3>

Let your heart grow and expand with ever broadening love, until, freed from all hatred, and passion, and condemnation, it embraces the whole universe with thoughtful tenderness.

As the flower opens its petals to receive the morning light, so open your soul more and more to the glorious light of Truth.

Soar upward on the wings of aspiration; be fearless and believe in the loftiest possibilities.

<h3>Meditation for the Day</h3>
Seek diligently the path of holiness.

THE giving up of self is not merely the renunciation of outward things. It consists of the renunciation of the inward sin, the inward error. Not by giving up vain clothing; not by relinquishing riches; not by abstaining from certain foods; not by speaking smooth words; not by merely doing these things is the Truth found.

But by giving up the spirit of vanity; by relinquishing the desire for riches; by abstaining from the lust of self-indulgence; by giving up all hatred, strife, condemnation, and self-seeking, and becoming gentle and pure at heart, by doing these things is the Truth found.

The renunciation of self is the way of Truth.

<h3>Thought for the Evening</h3>

Mind clothes itself in garments of its own making. Mind is the arbiter of life; it is the creator and shaper of conditions, and the recipient of its own results. It contains within itself both the power to create illusion and to perceive reality.

Mind is the infallible weaver of destiny; thought is the thread, good and evil deeds are the warp and woof, and the web, woven upon the loom of life, is character. Make pure thy heart, and thou wilt make thy life, rich, sweet, and beautiful, unmarred by strife.
