# Affirmations 2 (Sep 2021)

I have half my life left to live. It's been long and tough, But I AM MADE OF adamantine!

A sensitive kid and well bred, I use humour to mask my deepest feelings and tribulations.

Always told I would never "amount to much" I've learnt to shape that anger to push myself to excel in areas my peers would never dream of.

A quite successful business graduate, practitioner and employer, I soon plan to up the ante and teach at a few business schools.

Through it all, I have not lost the human touch, something that makes perfect sense to the kind of relationships I make - personal, professional and social.

I have a goofy buddy who tells me things he perceives about my inner strength and wisdom, a sliver of which he hopes I will pass on to my family, daughter and son.

Married nearly 10 years now, I'm genuinely ecstatic to be husband and father though it's not always a cakewalk. And it should not be, it's only the test of fire that makes fine steel.

Everyday of my life, I decide to "deny mediocrity", have something to BELIEVE IN, that sees the whole as so much MORE than the sum of its parts.

I let my spirituality and sense of identity enter into everything I do, and let the universe manifest my profoundest dreams. I love this crazy world and crazily, she loves me too.

Lovingly, Me
