Lord, I wish that my faith in the process of life unfolding grows as I have the courage to walk the path and let myself become who you intended me to.

Lord, I may still be a student, sometimes unhappy with my lot and limitations but I am willing to learn, find strength and adapt to situations I encounter.

Lord I am anxious to become a success and be chosen in the right kind of work atmosphere and I put my full confidence in you.

Lord I will use every life's lesson that comes my way to the best, never forgetting to speak to others of your children, offering comfort and suggestions whenever possible.

Lord I look forward to all those experiences planned by you, that will help shape me into the person you want me to become.

Lord I will learn to be kind and generous as I hope others will be kind to me, but I will not expect this of them, nor will that wrong attitude witnessed ever stop me from giving more of myself. It it a blessed life I lead and one day will understand why you threw so many challenges at me.

Lord I will daily strive to work harder in my chosen field of study and endeavour, ever remembering the lessons I learn and putting them all to good use.
