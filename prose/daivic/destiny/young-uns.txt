<!--markdown-->Dear Young Uns,


Grant us that we have your best intentions at heart, a lesson I'm learning dearly at 39 with regards my own family.

We are overprotective because we worry for your future and your upbringing and right conduct or poise.

If you are smarter or more creative it's because we either didn't have the breaks early on, instead suffering some privation or other and are fighting today to give you every advantage we never had.

You ARE smarter and more creative because that's the law of evolution. There is however a cosmic debt that links us all, as we give our best and become our best.

I never had a healthy relationship with my dear departed father because of differences of opinion and perspective, and it is with much pain and tears that I IMPLORE you to be good to your Parents, Elders and Siblings.

Rejoicingly Yours,

Imran
