# Kutty Aurobindo, circa 6 September 2022

I'm sure this was in jest, but once a friend called me Kutty (small) Aurobindo.

As each of us heals and lives to fulfil our #DivineDestiny, isn't is conceivable that we should infuse ourselves with the spirit of our heroes, whose chivalry we carry through our trials and who inspire us to deeds of surpassing valour.

Humanity, it is called upon me to beg you to be valiant in all that we do, for it is a special, glowing fire that burns at our kernel and wants to rout out every last vestige of human pettiness and lust.

I beg you in the name of every #Hero less or great that ever strove to establish truth and love.

You may take a moment to list all their names and recall them gently to the fore of you mind as you "find new heart as you think upon those windy [glorious] day(s)".

We have, after all "one life to live, so much to give, and so much to share. There is hope to be found, just look around", and you will see the stream of "angels among us" that since ever have raise humanity to it's highs.

When we remember our heroes (**fathers, mothers, cousins, friends, activists, freethinkers, poets, sportsmen and philanthropists - all** - /thanking them/), keeping them constantly in our waking (and dreaming) moments, it slowly shapes our thoughts words and deeds, **until the possibility of greatness is achieved**.
