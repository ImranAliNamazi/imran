> As our consciousness increases and we develop the latent faculties of the spiritual body / realm, we attain the varying levels of development of a "yogi" or "seer".
> 
> Krishna or Christ Consciousness can certainly be attained, all the more easily now that the Kali Yuga has ended and we are in Dwapara 321.
> 
> Truth is manifesting more spontaneously in the populace as more of us are following the path of the Yogin. Today we talk of "intellective vision - one that is full of truth" - in Sanskrit (the language of the Vedas), this is known as Rimtambhara Prazna.

What is Ritambhara Prazna?

In our relentless pursuit of the absolute truth, seeing beyond the samsara (world) and maya (illusion), with our illumined spiritual eye of insight / clairvoyance, there are 3 cloudings / untruths that must not taint our vision.

* Doubt
* Misconception
* Untruth

For each of these pre-conditions, there is a stipulation - the Yogi / Seer (one who has attained in Yoga) must be "devoid of any doubt" - <u>Samsaya</u>, he / she must further be "devoid of misconception" - <u>Viparyaya</u>, and finally the knowledge possessed / intuited should not in the minutest degree be "based on untruth or partial truth" - <u>Midhyazayana</u>.

Truth must shine like a beacon, never afraid to go into dark places and illumine the lives of the grace-bestowed souls who are nearing completion of the process of "inner awakening". For a Yogi who has attained "Ritambhara Prazna", this truth shines forth like a sun.

RITAMBHARA PRAZNA
 
Ritambhara 				= Full of truth.
Ritambhara Prazna   	= Intellective vision full of truth

This knowledge is devoid of:

Samsaya-Devoid of any doubt.
Viparyaya -Devoid of any misconception.
Midhyaznana- Devoid of knowledge based on untruth etc.

Hence, for a yogi who acquires "Ritambhara Prazna", truth alone shines in his knowledge.
 
HOW DOES A YOGI ACQUIRE RITAMBHARA PRAZNA?

Ritambhara prazna is beyond initial stages, like Clairvoyance.
For glimpses into Ritambhara prazna, one needs Nirvivhara state, Ekagra state, Controlled Vision, Aloka and Samahitha Chitta.

NIRVICHARA STATE
Between two consecutive thoughts, there is a small interval (however small it may be) - an interval of no thought. This is known as Chidakasha of the mind. One needs to expand this soonya state which is Nirvivhara State.
If one can have this even for a few seconds even, he can look into the future like a flash of lightning.

EKAGRA STAGE

Dharana and Dhyana are the building blocks for the higher stage of Yoga. Constant practice and perfection makes one reach the Ekagra Stage.

CHITTA AND KNOWLEDGE

MOODHAVASTHA

When a person is lazy, without aim, avoids work and so on, he is said to possess Chitta of Moodhavastha= Neurotic Stage. Knowledge is full of defects.

KSHIPTAVASTHA 

When a person is very active, the chitta is in Kshiptavastha =Psychic Stage.
They possess knowledge but have contradictory ideas. Knowledge is with imperfections.

VIKSHIPTAVASTHA

When a person has good intellect and follows Dharma-righteousness is in Vikshiptavastha =Mild Neurotic Stage. The knowledge is better than the above mentioned but is not devoid of imperfections.
This state of Chitta is a stepping stone for the future. It enables one to move forward for acquiring knowledge with less imperfection.

YEKAGRA STAGE

Beyond this state, for a person engaged in Yama, Niyama, Asana, pranayama, Pratyahara and dharana, the Chitta reaches Yekagra stage. Here, imperfections in knowledge get reduced.

NIRUDDHAVASTHA

With further progress in Yoga Practice in Samadhi state, one acquires Niruddhavastha stage. This enables knowledge with minimum imperfections.

SAMAHITA CHITTA

Through the constant practice of Samadhi, one's chitta gets purified, paving the way to reach various higher stages.
Chitta gets purified at a particular stage and then it becomes Samahitha Chitta.
This enables purity in intellect vision.

ALOKA

Acquiring this higher state Chitta enables one to concentrate on any object/subject whether it is physical/abstract. Further development leads to acquiring Sathwa Prakash known as Aloka.
Aloka is that power of the chitta, which when applied enlightens the hidden/latent powers of the mind, without the application of sensory organs enabling one to focus on areas/frontiers which are far away and far beyond the time barriers and have the knowledge of the objects/events accurately.
During Samyama, Aloka acts like a torch light/lightning and enables one to penetrate frontiers far beyond. At this stage, one gets the actual knowledge of an object and attains Prajna.
A Yogi attains the above Discrimination Power of Rithambhara Prazna after attaining
"Nirvicharanugatasampraznathasamadhi".
This state enables Yogis to acquire higher stages of knowledge in many fields and possess intellective vision full of truth.
During "Nirvicharanugatasampraznathasamadhi" yogi is in tune with shining object subject of samadhi . The object/subject of contemplation reveals its true nature.
With the application of Aloka, the object shines forth, revealing its actual state/nature.
Truth alone shines. One acquires Rithambhara Prazna.
RESULTS OF CONSTANT YOGA PRACTICE
Due to Prathyahara, the gross is destroyed.
Due to Dharana, the subtle expresses.
Due to Samadhi, the causal is awakened.
 
CONTROLLED VISION
After attaining Samahita Chitta, by observing Samyama and use/application of Aloka, one can get "controlled vision" of the future and also acquire other supernatural powers like Rithambharaprazna.
