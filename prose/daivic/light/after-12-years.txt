Have we advanced the soul?

It is said that the eternal law insists on being tested and put to the soul's uses, and in that wave of clarity and love, we find the basis for a future wisdom and the dawning of a new age.

There have been enough seers and saints who have heralded it.

Sometimes, in fact, very often, we only find out things by a process of elimination, the Neti Neti of the Vedas (Not This, Not this).

The realization is that the soul is always in a state of perfection and unalloyed bliss. I wouldn't use the words Maya or Samsara here for they are widely misunderstood.

The crux of it is the dogged clinging to hope, not in quiet desperation, but with an indomitable spirit, a submission to the forces of Nature that sanction our very existence.

I'm afraid to ramble on, for in my yearnings and birth pangs, I have neglected a doting mother, who, like Eliza says she's sick of all the words we blighters do utter.

Perhaps its time to ask what love the world family can show us? The careworn souls that seek release - not from the mortal coils, but the real life illusion of shackles.
