If you hurt, heal
If you know, grow
If you hate, forgive
If you're wronged, seek redressal
If you're lonely, love yourself
If you're young, learn
If you're happy, share
If you're sad, ruminate
If you're clueless, aim
If you're lost, discover
If you're amiable, find company
If you're shy, be bold
If you're unsure, go for it
If you love, don't let go
If you need me, I'm there
If you're spoiled, mature fast
If you're malleable, seek for grace
If you feel blessed, give graciously
If you anger, introspect
If you're nothing, build
If you're full, void yourself
If you're bitter, let go
If you're alive - LIVE!
If your caught, break free
If you're anxious, abide in peace
If you're rough, smoothen the burrs
If you desire, pursue with love
If life is rough, stay tough
If you're leaving, say we'll meet again
When your done, turn to your maker
