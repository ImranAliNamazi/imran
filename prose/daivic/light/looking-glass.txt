# What do I want with regards to YM?

<!-- Sep 2021 -->

I want to begin getting ideas that could "change the world" off the ground and have them take shape and gather momentum. While I do have my own ideas, and though I may seem rigid or obsessive about them, I am quite open to new ideas and changes of plan.

For some time I thought my USP was that I would first help others with their own dreams and this is still my intention, but I have found myself rather diluted with very little genuine heartfelt reciprocity in the past. I'm still open to promoting others with no other thought for gain than seeing a good idea utilized and yes, disruptive thinking / economics is still a part of what I aim to do.

Forgive me for being unclear.... Let me start afresh :-

I want to help people, and institute a system for sharing ideas and useful / inspiring stuff that catches like wildfire as more and more people share "what has worked for them in the past" - this could be insights into the human condition, articles promoting this or other program or article / product / habit / activity and genuinely taking the time to bond with, nurture, support and form a [triad of helping](https://youtu.be/PTIqjpkF5Ss?t=88) among the network.

I have long since said that I wanted to magnify the work of [various pillars of community](http://legacy.yieldmore.org/miu) and thought leaders, help individuals "heal through words", build virtual and physical communities and generally [catalyse goodness]([url]catalyst/), if indeed it springs in the perennial grass of the individual / collective psyche.

I also want to involve parents in the conscious decision to interact in a more wholesome manner with their children and children's peers / generation as we learn the arts of conscious living, parenting aging and so forth.

I also believe that the time to revolutionize the way we work has come - and here, ideas like joyland and evolving sunlight could be used / made freemium to onboard as many organizations and create facilitators as possible. A strong advocate of "passion for work" I am now trying these ideas out among a group of friends / past employers.

I am no shirker or "armchair warrior" though I've had to face my own demons and battles to get to where I am today - filled with a conviction that I can "set out to win my dreams" - and that some of you may find them rather wholesome. I daresay something in my [nearly 500 pieces of writing]([url]all/) may foreshow for you my marrow deep convictions.

What I am purporting to build should be "decentralized", self - accelerating and relevant with the irrefutable passage of time - a worthy cause for anyone considering the perennial inspiration that "[germs of good in every soul](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/topics/religion/)".

[ENTHEOS](https://yieldmore.org/ideas/) - could be a new religion - where passion for a life of purpose drives everyone.

Enough about me - Tell me a bit about yourself - your dreams and aspirations - where you befuddle yourself with and whose done what harm to you - the losses you've had on the road and the hopes you still cling on to and IF it's meant to be - where our two paths can meet and criss cross. I remain eager and glad to be of service.
