I f-f-f-found an arti-fi-ct - my heart, at the center of which is a deep well of love!

I was woken up today to the wonder that is all of creation.

A creativity bursting from moment to moment as we resonate with the love that is the center of the universe.

We don the robes of mortality whereas we are in-fact, one with the forces at the center of  the cosmos, one with our illimitable origins.

We actually know a lot about these forces - they appear as a gushing stream of water, refreshing our soul from instant to instant, known to some as existence, consciousness, bliss.

What bliss it is, to walk on a bed of green, to look up and see the havens so blue. To ponder the mysteries of the eternal, to play at the gates of tomorrow, never doubting, even for an instant, that true love will always sparkle and radiate peace.

Some doubt the existence of consciousness, but what do they know about the [measure of a man](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/curate/series/star-trek/s2e9-measure-of-a-man/), for its in an [August Rush]([url]joyland-welcome/) that we become one with the music, with the song of our selves, with the one note symphony of this Earth.

A new word of inspiration comes - the need to [stand our ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8i5NLyXZdc)!

So what principles do you have worth dying for? For we are dying - to the past moment, part of a movement thats trying to usher in a new age of e[il]li[u]mination. A new Earth - one brilliant bright...

Go, live your dreams... love your life, for thats [all you'll be](https://g.co/kgs/QTkMmq) - all the moments you reach out and KISS!
