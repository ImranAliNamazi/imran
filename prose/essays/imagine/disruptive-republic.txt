I am just one man, but one who begs people to listen to their hearts. Leave this lust for power, fame and wealth.

I tire to hear whose got this new gadget, or taken a trip to the Bahamas, or has a 74 inch television.

Tell me you still live with your parents, not packed them off to some old age home. Tell me a friend can still take 3 hours out of your Monday morning routine because they "feel lost". Tell me you've not tired of the challenge to be the best version of yourself you can be.

That you can watch children on a merry go round and teleport yourself back 30 years, that you feel the promise of each new day and look forward to giving your best.

Carpe Diem! Make your lives special boys and girls. I'm afraid the clock is ticking. So decide what it is that really makes you tick. Spend a lifetime finding that out. The good news is, we're evolving into something better. Have been for about 400 years since we declared firmly that the dark ages was ended. Now we just have to make sure everyone believes it!

Sales projections are team A telling themselves just how much money they are going to put into brainwashing people B to buy a product or service. I dont know who the winner is, it's not the consumer, or the salesman - they are just cogs in a larger wheel.

Everybody has something to sell, and we've reached a point of consumerism where we dont even know what need something we buy is filling. Get off the band wagon, take a trip to a quiet mountain, chop it down with the edge of your hand if you feel like it, but come back sure of what moves you and what you think a wholesome life could mean.

I only ask questions, and I'm headed off to find those mountains Niggle hinted at so long ago. The ones Maria painted for me. yieldmore.org/niggle

Off on a 3 day holiday to wrest from life its inmost secrets.

Lovingly,
Friar Imran
