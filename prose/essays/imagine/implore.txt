I was reminded once again that Mohammed was the "last prophet".

I always took it as the "last prophet that needed to found a religion".

I believe the dark ages ended in 1700 and that Christianity and Islam are peculiar in that they were created to offer a "path to salvation" during the dark ages, which they did.

Hinduism isn't an "ism" in the typical sense but an ancient way of life that promoted a spiritual democracy. That's why it's not rigid, rather embraces all.

Prophet, seer, mystic, saint, enlightened one. All these are established in truth and this Earth constantly produces men and women of the finest moral caliber which we seem to venerate.

Wha? is important is to understand the commonalities of all the messages and scriptures and let each follower embrace the faith in his heart.

I believe in the end, we shall find that our paths were not all that dissimilar.
