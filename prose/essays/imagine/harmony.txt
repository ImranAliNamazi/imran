Dear God, give man the fortitude to listen to the words of peace and love in his heart and not be swayed by the evil forces that abound in the world around him and incite him to commit acts against the very principles that his religion and beliefs are founded upon.<br />Grant him the understanding that each man is free to choose his religion, that none is superior to the other, that each man understands the will of God according to his own nature and the truth of his being.<br />If he must talk of his religion, let it be with an openness to understand his brother's religion as well, for as Lord Krishna says - All paths lead to me.<br />Let us hold hands and stand against the spread of ignorance and conflict.<br />Let us embrace one another and truly accept each other's faults and limitations as our Lord accepts us.<br />A minutes silence for contemplation and thoughts for world peace.<br />- Unspoken by Shasa, Nov 2015
