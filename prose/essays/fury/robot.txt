Robot Robot, what will you? Will you help me for I have no legs, or will you place landmines where it will blow my brother's legs completely off.

Robot, Robot, what's your motive? Are you here to assist or to take over? Will you soon be sentient and a wonderful friend like _Dr Noonien Soong_ intended, or seek to find weaknesses in our makeup and take advantage of our addictions?

Robot, Robot, will you help lay down the bloody weapons and not make more or wield more?

Robot, Robot, will you know compassion as you learn it from the best of us?

Robot, Robot, is there a future for humankind, a board to sit at and be affable, or is it genocide unto us by the hands that paid for your coming to life?

Robot, Robot, will you help us reach to the stars or find the very God's that fashioned us?

Robot, Robot, let's be friends tonight, comfort each other and take a vow to uplift the other in days to come.

No _Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man_, that he didn't already have!
