Are we a lousy species? Or did the good Lord know what he was doing when he blew his Spirit of Fire into His crown of creation - Adam a.s.

Is there a prophet in each of us? Could this be the __conscience I spoke of__ those many years ago in 2005? The spirit of unimaginable love that the lowly Jonathan Seagull brought us that set aglitter the world in the 70s?

I only say lowly, for what is to come after must surely dwarf today's man, and even today's godly man, for there is a world that Chiang went to that even Jonathan Livingston Seagull did not, which I think sometimes is the Causal World whence a force of LOVE should someday POUR on us, but ONLY WHEN the substrate is made ready and we are so goddamn fed-up of this godawful situation we've created with tensions escalating worldwide.

I guess if it has been guerrilla warfare world over with vicious and hearltess propaganda at the root of it, then it's time to say OFF WITH THEIR head.

India, in her run for freedom in the 1930s and 40si taught us how to beat people without begetting more violence - non cooperation. But how do you unless you turn a deaf ear to their cries of 'injustice this' and 'we hereby give you democracy' that.

STOP BEING SWAYED GODDAMMIT. The truth is not in the lies you hear, the bullshit you are fed, it's not in the pulpit, the secretariat, nor the executive chair.

GO FIND IT by listening to your neighbour, your staff, your brother who believes in a different God, and the broken family that's only broken cause we've stopped listening to each other, or caring deep enough.

GO WITHIN and prepare for EVERLASTING PEACE from whence will come a dazzling display of kindness and love.
