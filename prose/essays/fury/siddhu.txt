Thambi Siddharth Avargale,

"The bond that links us to our true families" is one of love, delight, concern and steadfastness. Pray Lord, that each day and shared moment, those bonds grow deeper, the circle wider and the strength to face obstacles and sorrow greater.

Now I truly feel we are as one and can begin to fulfil our shared destinies as I recover. As they say, experience and lost youth are a hell of a price to pay for wisdom.

Do begin sifting through my ideas and give them the needed top spin and help me to make [these ideas](https://ideas.yieldmore.org/) relevant to you. I wish to remain only an ideator and let others drive things so we can, in our /symphony/ be found /growing-together/.

Now let me touch on your journey - remember the divine is working its way through to a WORLD UNIFICATION and that America - the Mecca of the west is where the fighting is thickest - so do spread the message of [The Gita](https://ideas.yieldmore.org/gita/) where you can and link those pockets of love.

GO, Acharya, among so many things and [speak of the RASA of things](https://joyfulearth.org).

I hope you find love, but I would say, let it not be an Indian or Iyer girl - for that is how we [Dapple](#gc-imran-video).

FORD EVERY STREAM - FOLLOW EVERY RAINBOW UNTIL YOU FIND YOUR DREAM.

Go in peace my love.

Hari Om Tat Sat.
