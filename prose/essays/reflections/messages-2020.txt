<h2>Independance Day 2020</h2>

With every day that passes of our complacence and aloofness, the dark forces' position becomes stronger!

We like to talk of liberty, but where is the freedom for the people who work with no choice.. have to watch their children grow up with less and less options because of their diminished education, exposure or social status?

How is it so easy for political tensions within and between nations to warp our thinking and wrongly guide our actions? When will we be so at peace instead of lusting after money, fame and power?

When will tranquillity reign in our homes and right conduct guide the way we interact with our family - near and far?

When will fairness and equitability enter into our business dealings? When will we stop letting religious and ideological differences cause friction and chaos?

When will people, world over, feel safe - that life is truly a gift and living a continuous cause for celebration?

We have a glorious destiny to fulfil, but it takes much conscious thought and continuous effort. Let's promise to try harder to be good to ourselves and those around us and build a veritable heaven on Earth.

Think how far we've come as a civilization since 1947 when Sri Aurobindo spoke of what all could be achieved if we put our minds to it:

Think also of the dream that is Auroville where the blueprint of a future oneness and synergy is being worked out:

Remember, the power is yours! So band together and create a fresh, powerful and tasteful narrative.

Jagat kula ki prem - all love to the world family!

<h2>Eid Mubarak - 24 May 2020</h2>

I urge you brothers and sisters as Eid ends and a new year continues, to look at all humanity with more kindness in your heart.

Remove the distrust and discord from your head and look to one another with benevolence and a gentle, genuine warmth.

Islam truly means peace and now that you have made it with yourself and your understanding of God, go now and let peace and love govern your words and deeds.

We have not much time on this planet so lets not spend it on unwholesome or vain pursuits. Let's use our every force to uplift and nurture.

The month spent in reflection should have given an opportunity for your true nature to spring forth. I hope you discovered a self that inspires you, that you are comfortable being and have no dissonance with.

Every religion has only contributed to the glory of the whole, so show your fellow being the true pious and charitable nature engrained in the Muslim mindset.

Take also the good from other teachings and live a life of virtue and benevolence. Every single soul, thought and action is magnified as the drops become an ocean, so do what your conscience dictates and continue to live an inspired, wonderful life.
