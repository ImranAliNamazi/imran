An email I wrote to Richard Bach on Jul 20th 2019. It's full of references to his characters in his book <a class="ym" href="http://yieldmore.org/curious-lives/" target="_blank">Curious Lives</a>. I will in time work this into an essay on what Taminder Ferret meant to Budgeron, then Richard, then ME!

Is it time to pass Taminder's legacy on to a human of ferret origins?

Are we relearning the courtesies?

Have Monty's students mastered the way from within?

Have Stormy and Strobe built their legacy upto  Critical Mass?

Are the simple gestures of one Avedoi Merek understood by those of previous petty and destructive mindset?

Have the discoveries of USS Discover been put to use in saving this Earth or EÃ¤?

Are Chloe and Bethany still the best of friends?

Has Boa passed on his learning to new generations of Engineers?

Has the Count finally learnt his mathematics?

Aren't there indeed Angels among us?

Dearest Richard,

Your books have always spoken to my inmost heart...

I may still be an amateur writer but I promise I wont EVER quit?

Happy Landings!

PS I am curious to know how Taminder got his name.
