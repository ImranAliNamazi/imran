Hi Richard,

I've been a big fan for the last 15 years. Am only 32 so thats most of my life!

Lately I've been inspired to create a kind of collaborative website for inspiration and progressive thinking and books are a critical for this to be the most impactful.

My idea is to make the actual content of books available and I'm trying to do this legally. The idea on my website is to have the book content, like:
<a href="http://yieldmore.org/works/prometheus-unbound/">yieldmore.org/works/prometheus-unbound</a>
available and then for users to share quotes and cite it in discussions and articles.

It would be sad if all I could do was link the books at
<a href="http://yieldmore.org/authors/richard-bach/">yieldmore.org/authors/richard-bach</a>
back to Amazon / other retail stores. It would be better if we could have copyright as detailed here:
http://yieldmore.org/pages/biblios/

I actually wrote this to you and other copyright holders in 2013 when I was in America briefly and for the first time

I would like permission to publish your more inspirational books on my website.

I love the way you say in Curious Lives that you would walk out and rebuild the universe. Its with a passion like that that I'm trying to make this baby work. So please, help me. And may the force be with you.

Always,
Yours Lovingly,
Imran Ali Namazi
