<h2>No Less Brittle</h2>
Shasa, June 5, 2011

When's the last time an Atheist paused in his reckless abandon at being free of his shackles to accept the notion that everything religious is not moot.

Or a firm monotheist with no particular convictions think about the validity of everything he despised.

Is it really so hard to reconcile our differences? To accept that each one's truth is simply that - his own. No less true for respecting the other for it.

I read Day of Judgement and had a profound religious experience alongside of <a href="http://www.epinions.com/review/Jack_Higgins_Day_of_Judgment_epi/content_476579663492" target="_blank">Father Erich Hartman</a>. I think now, it was these words that <a href="http://lyrics.wikia.com/Jo_Dee_Messina:Burn" target="_blank">rang true</a> (the soldier bit).

Brought me again back to what is the real difference between the atheist, the anonymous monotheist and the fundamentalist? I think were all just at little different parts of the same confusion cycle. Mistaking our truth for the real truth.

So let's all be a little more tolerant. Of our own inadequacies. We're only hateful when we see it in others cause it reminds us of our own helplessness.

I can't think of any other way to put it.

Let's not allow this (MGM Cartoon scenario mentioned below) to happen. We can reform before its too late. Oh... and worry about yourselves first. Each one has to face his own Day of Judgement.

<blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_on_Earth_(film)" target="_blank">Peace on Earth</a> is a 1939 MGM cartoon about a post-apocalyptic world populated only by animals. Two young squirrels ask their grandfather on Christmas Eve who the "men" are in the lyric "peace on Earth, good will to men." The grandfather squirrel then tells them a history of the human race, focusing on the never-ending wars men waged.</blockquote>
