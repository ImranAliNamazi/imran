The quality of Mercy - Shasa, 21 Nov 2015

You never know who is a true believer so dont judge or condemn other people. Seek knowledge, expression and betterment from cradle to grave. It matters not what other people think of you but that you are true to your own conscience.

Life has a certain rhythm; you just have to tune out the noise. Sometimes the best way to find out what you are is by asking yourself what you are NOT.

Demons and daisies ^1 all heading from the inconscient back to the sublime - which means again, don't condemn, only love and acceptance can create the humanity of tomorrow.

Forgive my trespasses as I forgive those who trespass against me ^2.

Engender good and stand up to injustice ^3. But condemn the sin not the sinner ^4 for the pen is truly mightier that the sword - therefore educate. Ask yourself is it punishment you seek or reformation?

... for she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals, so easy to begin and then impossible to end ^5.

Father into your hands I commend my spirit ^6, thy will be done on Earth as it is in HEAVEN ^7.

^1 Shasas love thy self
