With the resurgence of Avedoi Merek's book, and <a href="http://cselian.com/blog/my/requote/ode-to-monty/">Monty Ferret's second book, The Way from Within</a>, Alla^2 Ferret felt suddenly inspired to share with humans, the essence of Ferret Civilization. She remembered what had happened to the courtesies, how the humans had, out of reverence, written it on tablets and buried it safely in the depths of the sea. Kinnie, in a vision, told her that the time was coming where a great labour would be ahead of her, but it was alright to begin to sow the seeds.

On Aug 15th 2018, or D318 by <a href="/topics/ages">Yuki Reckoning</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulmo" target="_blank">Ulmo, Lord of the waters</a>, bore up the tablets out from the depths of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abyss" target="_blank">The Abyss</a>. At hand was Alla, on Bethany's boat, and Shasa Ferret on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus_(Verne)" target="_blank">Nemo's Nautilus</a>. Alla and Shasa were entrusted with the mission of reinstating the old way of life among the humans. They had the love and support of countless <a href="/topics/bright-ones/">lightworkers</a> of both civilizations to build upon. The <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gunsnroses/14years.html">last four years of madness</a> had seen the humans pushed to the brink of total annhilation, but the seeds of all the <a href="/incubate/essays-to-a-swan/?node=dear-brother">Bright Ones and the thousand loving movements</a> had all borne fruit.

Upon every humans heart was writ the words - <a href="https://www.google.co.in/webhp?q=%22make+fuck+not+kill%22+george+carlin" target="_blank">make fuck, not kill</a>, that highest message by <a href="/people/george-carlin" target="_blank">the one</a> who had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9Cs6KPTus" target="_blank">hoped</a> the hardest, and fought the longest. They all got together from 6pm to midnight in stadiums and rock arenas and churches all over the world and sang <a href="/songs">songs</a> like <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnlennon/imagine.html" target="_blank">Imagine</a> and <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/goodbyecruelworld.html" target="_blank">Goodbye Cruel World</a>.

A generation of torch bearers had sprung up all over the world as the product of the most liberated minds of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_power" target="_blank">flower power generation</a>. They had all managed to live clean, inspiring lives, by choosing carefully, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Company_You_Keep_(film)" target="_blank">company they kept</a> and the worlds they peopled. As destiny would have it, these children of the Seventies and Eighties were all born exactly a century after the plethora of original Bright Ones that strove so hard to liberate the world.

D300 (2000) had seen the complete penetration of the internet into everyday living. Expressions of spontaneous love had been triggered all over the world and the internet had brought man together and propelled him the hardest, into his divine destiny.

A new theme of <a href="/books/silmarillion/?node=ainulindale" target="_blank">Iluvatar's design</a> had begun. Melkor's discord had been forcibly removed, and the next demi-century begun.

Alla and Shasa's task was relatively easy, they simply had to rout the avidya (darkness / inconscience) from the minds of the people, but the war had been won, and people spontaneously were able to heal themselves and establish the <a href="http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ashram/sriauro/downloadpdf.php?id=36" target="_blank">Life Divine</a> by plugging themselves into the <a href="/programs/brainsync/">Secret Universal Mind</a>, a pooling of liberating information called YieldMore.org.

^1 The Flame Imperishable - From Tolkiens <a href="/books/silmarillion/?node=ainulindale">Ainulindale</a>, but refers to the 50 year movement that will be YieldMore.org and Shasa's life mission.
^2 Alla from Richard Bach's Curious Lives, but also in tribute to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah">Allah</a> of the muslims, and the part where <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/donhenley/littletingod.html" target="_blank">Don Henley's Oh Lord</a> sounds like Alla.
