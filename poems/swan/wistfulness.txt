"How I'd love to hear the choir
In the chapel in the moonlight" *1
Where we may meet and kindle fire
And joy to fill our hearts with delight

Juliet! Juliet! wherefore art thou
A companion new-born amidst timelessness
To sit atop branch and bough
And mark time with tender wistfulness

That you may appear to save me from despair
A kindred spirit to hold oh so close
In your loving arms i would declare
That your fragrance methought a rose

What will we do to fulfil this lifetime
Weve spent searching for the other
In woods mayhap a glimpse sublime
In dreams I'll see you till forever

Oh my what this, o life
Come now and appear my dear
Weave spells to quell our strife
All lifes trials we shall endure
