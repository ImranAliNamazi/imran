To live in the protection of her love.

To know we were raised in ceaseless toil.

Taking food clothes and entertainment for granted.

Few realise the absolute greatness that lies concealed by this mortal frame.

To have suspended her own dreams for our upkeep.

To have been our eyes and ears only letting the soft and wholesome enter our consciousness.

To have looked after our friends and playmates as if her own. healing our hurts and uplifting our mood.

To imbibe us with good qualities, leading by example and routing out the flaws in our character.

To turn us inward and connect with that divine spark, teaching us to contemplate the bounties of nature.

To have kept a gay front even when there were tears inside to keep us innocent of sorrow.

To read stories filling our imagination with lands far away and deeds of characters to look up to.

To give us a lap to cry on when were disappointed and a place to voice our fears and misgivings.

All this and more a mother does for us for loves sake. always in keeping with her sense of highest right.

A worthy co conspirator of that Universal Mother who holds all of creation in the palm of her hand.
