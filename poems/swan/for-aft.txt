In continuation to <a href="../sara/">sara</a> and <a href="../letters-jun2017/#atoms">atoms</a> and in continued search of Tracey, lucky number 10.

I give thanks to thee for giving life purpose, direction, hope and joy...

To 1 for teaching me that you are never too young to learn to love and never too old to forget your first love.

To 2 for being the most kindred spirit I have ever known. Whose memory hasn't faded a shade. Who loves me because I am an innocent man. Us two always in Communion.

To 3 for being the best of what nature has to offer. How I wish we could start over. I can't go back 20 years but in another 20 mayhap ye shalt come abide in mine arms.

To A, my best friend through college who loved me for what I was and what I was capable of becoming. Whose memory lingers on but when you pass me by, I think I see a teardrop in the corner of your eye. Fool for saying no, but hey, no regrets.

To B for being there and helping me rethink my self worth. B for Brief. Oh how quickly those 14 months went by.

To C for melting at my touch. I do hope you find joy again. May the water come and carry us away.

To D for all those kisses and hugs. Cry I did the day in which from my midst you did depart.

To E for the time you did give me. Perhaps the gentlest and most patient of the lot. Ah when love is new, now and forever, under the bridges of Paris with you.

To F who made me feel young again. As a little boy setting out to win his dreams. The most joy I've known were in those moments snatched from those dark clouds that separate us. Who catalysed my final reanimation. The cutest of all the very many girls I don't know
