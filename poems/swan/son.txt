Hello Dear Son,

An angel you came into our midst
Sweet and graceful, pure and lovable

Daddy was so busy, but you
Would wait up to welcome him home

Making paintings of trees and rainbows
Playing with jigsaws and building blocks

So much time spent in reading
And dreaming of love when you were older

Now the time has come and grow you have
Into this wonderful man who stands beside me

At loggerheads with those who dont understand
The meaning of love you bring

To touch lives with your joy and abundance
And reach out to people you care for deeply

Passionate about this journey we call life
And thirsting to make people happy

Get out of your cocoon and <a href="https://legacy.yieldmore.org/works/jonathan-livingston-seagull/?node=part2&pg=17" target="_blank">fly
Up and find the meaning of love</a>
