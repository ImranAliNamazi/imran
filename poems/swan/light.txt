The magic has gone the grief still raw
The cat still teases the mouse in its paw
Of days gone by I would surely weep
Thinking of all the sentiments I keep

The most love I ever gave a body
Was in those months of u beside me
A stirring deep within my heart
Write letters I did to impress with art

You were the first to look deep inside
And draw me out and no longer hide
A man in blossom with dreams to cherish
A rock of ages whose love doesn't perish

So deep the bond we lovingly forged
Feel you beside me our lips engorged
We kissed and kissed until I awoke
Beside me how tenderly you spoke

That dream has gone the pain so real
The moments we shared so deep I feel
Time has flown so piercingly I feel
Your light ebb from me my senses reel
