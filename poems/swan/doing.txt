"You serve god best when you love"
Doing the sorts of things
That would make your parents proud
Giving of yourself to dear ones and the needy

But mostly to the ones you've bonded with
Short this life, and time flies
Immersed in a stream of action
We work out our karmas

But what of our collective karma
That shows were all
Brought under the same Judge
Who, with his benevolent glance

Chastises us for time wasted.
In and of this world we are,
A tribute to our comrades,
Doing His work, ever mindful

That time is short, giving him our best days
So that, when we enter at the pearly gates
Were at peace with ourselves
For all we did, we did in service to Him.
