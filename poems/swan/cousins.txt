A friendship foreplanned at birth
We're welded together as we grow
An extension of our families
We treasure the memories we accumulate

Of mischievous deeds and healthy fun
We have at each others expense
A familiarity and camaraderie
That survives every curve ball life throws at us

In times of trouble we stand steadfast
Supporting each other as is our wont
A small trickle of love that engulfs us both
And makes us stronger to face our trials

As we grow in the ways of the world
We enliven each other's lives
And bring in nephews and nieces
To magnify this love we share

A new generation of cousins once more
That find life's little joys in their own time
At last we can look back at life
That was enriched by these bonds we made
