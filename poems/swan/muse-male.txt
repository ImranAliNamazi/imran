That font of manliness that inspires us
A grace from God to cherish and protect us
We've spent a lifetime together
And found "true love will never fade" *1

The centre of our universe
Whose warm smile completes
The feeling of love in our hearts
Whose graceful nature and toil

Kept us in abundance and comfort
Gentle with our children he brought
A certain love for mankind in their hearts
And also for Mother Nature and Father Supreme

He inspired us to sing of love for all things
And paint trees and animals and birds
Take care of us he did - tender loving care
To make our burdens easier to bear

Protecting us from the outside world and its evils
We discovered a world within our hearts
Peopled by others of our kind
In true harmony with the ways of our lord
