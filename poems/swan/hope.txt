Spring it does, eternal in the human breast
The silver lining in clouds that pass
Recharging ourselves amidst all strife
A silent shoot to latch onto

While the powerful play goes on
Fortifying us to contribute our own verse
Often it is thought that triggers
The memory of days of joy

A memory so powerful as to
Dispel the shadow of doubt that engulfs us
An intense feeling that revives a sense of purpose
Naked and fearless in the elements *1

We plod on along with life's ebbs and flows
Hope and despair in all its forms and guises
But nothing can over-dampen our mood
Unless in folly we allow it to

Hope for love; hope for treasure;
Hope to be loved; hope for grace;
Hope to dispel all darkness
And live eternal in God's light of love
