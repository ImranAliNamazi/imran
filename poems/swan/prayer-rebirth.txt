Dear God,

We pray for all those dear departed souls.

May they have met the moment of death with calm and peacefulness and little or no discomfort, pain or trepidation.

May they have soon realized that they had passed away from us and not look back to us with sadness, attachment or regret.

May their short visit to the world between lives be full of courage, acceptance and daring.

May they not be lured into phantasmal worlds which are hard to come out of.

May they not be too harsh on themselves in judgement of their past birth and their actions therein.

May their time in purgatory / heaven / hell be adequate and productive.

May they choose wisely their next birth (or afterlife) and be granted your Grace.

May they once again become intimate with life's secrets, never forgetting, no matter the travails.

Amen
