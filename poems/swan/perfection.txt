Perfection is a state of mind
In which there is abundance of every kind
It springs from a deep well of love
As enchanting as the flight of a dove

Upto the kernel of our heart it resonates
Deep seated in our mind it liberates
There is no season in which it wont
Guide us,
Erupting from moment to moment inside us

Long we desire to exist
Continually in this state of bliss
Freed from the duality of life
Instinct driven and rid of strife

In love we find that storehouse
Which triggers activity all around us
Crystal clear like snowy springs
What joy to feel that emotion it brings

With people we keep our trysts
Helping those blow away the mists
That cloud them and rob them of bliss
Ensuring they never take life amiss
