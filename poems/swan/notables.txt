Be careful of The Company You Keep *1
Rather than at life's end you sit and weep
For in that War of Wrath by the Valar was lost
Many things that should not have come to aught

Cortlandt *3 was dynamited by its creator
For Altruism *4 he didn't feel was better
Than a construct of Niggle in whose Parish
Was built and consecrated a fervent wish

That all things bright and beautiful
Should live in Yavanna's *5 land of thrill
Where nature would fashion and become
Like the Eden in What Dreams May Come *6

At Kirrin Island *7 we found a joy springing like a fount
That would in later days come back to haunt
Us for we amidst the rat race had lost our Voice
In the Wilderness *8 faced with little choice

But to rediscover the Flame Imperishable *9
Set in the heart of every man able
To Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun *10
And with Agape *11, set our souls to Burn *12
