"So be closer to believing
Though your world is torn apart
For a moment changes all things
And to end is but to start

And if your journeys unrewarded
May your God lift up your heart" *1
With me by your side to support
You through your good times and bad

To be by your side in everything that you do
To be sought with hours to live *2
And to spend them well
Enhancing our lives through the love we share

In all the little things we do together
A friendship through thick and thin
Mirroring that gleam in each others eyes
Live we do in the warmth of our hearts

A timeless liaison of bonding and brotherly love
Supporting one another, enriched by time
Forever and forever
A fraternity that sees us through
