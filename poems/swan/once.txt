It happened once before
Love came to reanimate my soul
The days blurred into a corridor
Of light and you constantly at my side

Fierce this love a thing to behold
Lift me it did from my inanimate stupor
High I rode on a magic carpet
My heart daring to dream again

The thought of you filled my days
I couldn't sleep without kissing your picture
My elation crested my confidence waxed
I tried hard to impress you with my humanity

A careless word a thoughtless deed
And I alone to face lifes drabbiness
I was beside myself with grief at the thought
That love so pure and pristine could come to aught

Now I look back to the past
Spent in spirit but not wistful
For the next time I shall savour with care
Every moment that two lovers can share
