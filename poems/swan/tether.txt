Every time I look at you*1 I see the world in a different light
My heart beats aflutter,  it happens day and night *2
Pray fervently that love comes to us all
In clear skies or a stormy squall

In days gone by I built an image of love in my head
And now I find im missing... missing you instead
What hope for a dream that we may meet at last
A lifetime beside you I pray to you come fast

A pretty girl I saw and wondered would you be like her
A girl to ride besides in sun or  stormy weather
At night my chest expands and i think nobody loves you like I do *3.
So come quick and let's ride along the open road us two

Calm and reposed battling our travails together
Amidst life's designs in hope for a glimmer
Of love to enrapture and make us meld into one
Two hearts beating together, that prize we have won

You'll always have my unspoken passion
Whilst I dream ways to forge and fashion
A joyful life full of meaning to spend together
To run the course, have each other as tether

*1 in my mind
*2 same ending words as the first 2 lines of sing a song of freedom by Cliff Richard
*3 elp song
