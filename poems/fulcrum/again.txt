I have a friend whose afraid to love again, he's torn inside
Grieving much for his lover simply one day cast him aside
I never bring it up for I don't want him to remember pain
Instead I hope one day, he'll meet a girl, fall in love again

They do this better in the west. They trust their children
Let them explore and be candid, not knowing just when
That relationship will blossom into a lifelong romance
But this is India where we make our kids take a chance

We do cast horoscopes but that's not always telling
Of the problems ahead, the couple's hearts tearing
As this or other difference escalates out of control
Leaving one or other shattered, leaving them cold

And angry at each other, a fury that can really last
Many many years as they refuse to let go of the past
Now I have to beg him to move on as soon as he can
For the past is pain, makes him the shadow of a man

Dear friend, I now wish you the best of companionship
A sweet and loving girl over whom you can really flip
I leave you alone now to mend in your own time and way
And hope someone comes to turn your night into day
