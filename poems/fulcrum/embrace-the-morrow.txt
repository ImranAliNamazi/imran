Even when death nears, memories bid us wait and ponder
How then can I let go a memory fresh as yesterday
When love was new and my heart surged in wonder
When I kissed her and she bid me hold her and sway

A reluctance is on us to let go of old good feelings
We lose a chance to embrace the upcoming moment
This insistence on the past stops us from feeling things
I say to you - break the cycle of heart wrenching torment

New love may come to you this minute, so brood not
Rather think joyously of the rhythm of your emotions
Let your heart mend, think of the good things you've got
Be at peace, surrendering yourself to present wins

I know its not easy but on letting go, we're choosing life
And not dwelling unnecessarily on highs from our past
Letting go is healing, the past cut away as by a knife
Instead we focus on the now and build a future to last

The tragedy of love is that all you get is a song from it
So shake away the memories and build new ones
Let the song embrace tomorrow and all thats in it
Coz we're built to love, now dance on verdant lawns
