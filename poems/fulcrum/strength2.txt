Remember the old world mettle you acquired this lifetime
You gave me some, and now I'd help turn your life sublime
So open up dear brother and tell me what causes you pain
I know its hard, but I'm here until you learn to love again!

The world may spin on callously as you suffer alone
Do cry, dont bottle anything, being cut to the bone
I'm sorry that people around all seem self centered
We make so much noise, we fail to see your in tears

Stand forth to center and be called out in loving honour
You stand tall, dwarving us with your immense stature
I've been jaded by the wall of pain that surrounds all
The people I love, perhaps it's my turn to stand tall!

I wish you strength to battle each day, as you sing
Gladly with that melodic voice that healing does bring
Aure entuluva - that day shall come again as we wend
Our own ways to our maker, our hearts on the mend

Night is passing, so submit yourself to the threshing floor
Cry out in joy as life leaves you simply begging for more
I know that people around can be complete dicks
So beat them if you will with fire hardened sticks
