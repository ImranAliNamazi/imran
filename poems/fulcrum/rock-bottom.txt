I feel anxious, lost, confused, rotten, and devoid of all hope
I'm sick of my old life, I'm gonna clean up, avoid any more dope
The time has come, I know that I am ripe for a Divine change
I think I have no strength, so I implore you Lord - make me sane

I feel the pressing need for guidance, a slender beam of light
Time for me to awaken the Guru inside & fight with all my might
No more silly habits or mind games, it's time to become serious
How to become responsible? I've lost time for which I am now furious

Lazy and stubborn I have been up to now, but with hope renewed
I know I'll conquer the summits one day - good qualities imbued
Exhausted and angry, I now look for ways to vent my frustrations
Or perhaps I should LIVE in the light, not give in to any botherations

I don't know if good sense will prevail, but I feel an urge to change
There's joyous journeys to make, comrades to find out upon the range
Positive thinking is good but not enough, I need to make solid plans
As I find peace on Earth and poise begins to reign - time for a better stance

I've not given my best to the loved ones that surround me, especially mum
I don't know where to begin, it pains me to see her despondent and glum
Where the road leads, we know not - but there's gold at the end of the rainbow
So, Lord, I entreat Thee to be gentle with me as from this soil I begin to grow
