Today 3 men start working the claim of a gold mine
They're heavily invested and have their wits about
They're looking for people to work, spend valuable time
Building up Panishq Solutions - watch it sprout

Into a veritable jewel - the right mix of enthusiasm,
Dedication and passion - it's been a while in the making
Now time to plumb to its depths that mine's chasm
And bring up enough gold to make a dainty ring

For those who would appreciate the finer things in
life. Nishq is gold and Ishq, love. We offer our work to you
With love, hoping you will see the gold shine within
We work that teammates should never be blue

Always serving the public to their best interests
We start small today, but ahead are joyful days
We're ready to face challenge and fiery tempests

And may the thoughts, words, and actions
of [our] own life contribute in some way to
that happiness and to that freedom for all"
