Command me Lord to let go of limitation and unrealities
Grant me wisdom to see past illusions and temporalities
Help me place my faith in you, love and servitude for all
Guide me to transcend differences, tear down any wall

The days go by in a blur, its hard to find inspiration
I must let go this battered self, help build a nation
Of free spirited warriors who toil with dedication
To establish your peace, oust any and all limitation

Command me Lord to do your bidding with utmost care
To help my fellow creatures breathe freely the fresh air
That abounds in the world if only they'd open their eyes
And see the starlit truth, a truth free of any disguise

Theres plenty of work to do and we must toil without rest
Establish the Life Divine, give each person our very best
Build a better future with fervour enjoyed by one and all
Be heroic in all that we do, amidst the battle stand tall

<strong>Command us Lord, to be our most sensitive and kind
Show each other love, help find a way out of this bind
Tomorrow the Kingdom is ours so help us to always be
Excellent to one another, for thus, we show love for Thee</strong>
