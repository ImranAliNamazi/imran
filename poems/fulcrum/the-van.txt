I go not in the Van, but I study its progress as we join the battle with renewed vigour
I am not in the rear though I have just come up from there, being given grace
I am not a leader, nor a valiant fighter, I fight not with action but with words
Words to stir and steer a thousand valiant fighters and shape a leader or two

I have seen Centurions fight with technology and firepower
Swat Kats win the day by sweat, toil and excellence - and with style
I wonder when oh Lord, when will it be my time when I will be battle ready
And fight like a berserker, enraptured with love as Green Lanterns do

<strong>Can I lead a war as that Kuru did against Rome when he fought oppression and tyranny
Or will it all end in hopelessness as it did for those 6000 men of Spartacus
What if I found 300 men and women who stood by me as Warriors of Light
Can we work hard to liberate other people, save them from their plight</strong>

So many stories and images fill my head, its hard to keep from going insane
Will we ever find Inner Peace in the Lake of Manasarovar - our racing minds
Filled with our turbid consciousness and well intentioned nothings
Plans that come to ought or just a page of scribbled lines - unclear, undeveloped

Perhaps I should master the skills of telepathy and telekinesis
Or just get off my butt and do a thing or two, whatever it is, I mean well
Though you tire of waiting for when ill engage with reality
I struggle hard Oh Lord, but think I'd like to be an analyst, going in the Van
