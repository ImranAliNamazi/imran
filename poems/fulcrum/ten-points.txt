Two and a score years I searched for you very tenderly
When we met, I didn't realise what you'd mean to me
Though, if I had met you when I was a wee ten
My heart would have flipped there and then

You fill up my senses like the mountains in springtime
Like a walk in a field of dandelions, sets me full of rhyme
Your voice washes away all my sadness and my pain
I'd gift you an island and make love to you again

I'd build a temple in that island and set it's bells tinkling
The thought of your touch leaves my skin a tingling
My throat dries up when I think of taking you to bed
Will you let me spoon beside you and give you head?

Would we have children to raise in the light I wonder
Don't you realize I'll be forever yours oh dear lover
Your gentleness is the very sunlight of my universe
I remember your poems, how you guided my verse

I'm sorry you didnt get that one thing you dreamed off
I can love you forever, show I'm made of tender stuff
As causes a symphony of joy to course within you
10 points lover, and let each day bring me nearer to you
