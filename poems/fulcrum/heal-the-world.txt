What we all need is a little more patience, understanding and love
We need to plant these as seeds and saplings in Mother Earth's grove
It's time to forget our turbulent past and grow strong in the light
Let joy and abundance come ticle us till we gasp with delight

I thought I knew all the answers but now I'm a little unsure
Healing begins with those around us, of that I am very sure
Neglecting your lot is escaping from reality - here is family
That I need for my own life to make sense, end the tale happily

I cannot wear two faces, be a source of delight to my friends
And vent out frustrations at home - I cannot be more dense
Flitting like a butterfly from problem to problem is not an answer
Instead I need to stop avoiding talking, instead heal my mother

With my good cheer and joyfulness as I have learnt from life
Being a reflected spirit as a full moon in still waters - no strife
As I wade through the river of life, my heart waiting expectantly
For moments when joy brims over, an emotion takes me suddenly

When we save a single soul, it is like saving the entire world
So I choose my mother, watch delighted as her dreams unfold
And I become the man I wanted to be, a joy to all who behold
Whose grounded as bedrock, timeless, and sets the world awhirl
