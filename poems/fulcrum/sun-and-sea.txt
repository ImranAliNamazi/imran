How I would love to spend a year by the sea
Talking to the turtles at sunup, spreading glee
Wherever I go, the wind tries to make me smile
No more concrete jungle which to me is vile

<strong>Joy springs from the deepest well inside me
I give thanks to everything that gives me glee
And to things that makes me frown for that is how
The world works to touch us through what we know</strong>

I thank you Lord for loving and incredible parents
Kind souls who grace us by living by your tenets
I think of friends too, going through ups and downs
I agree with Patch who says WE NEED MORE CLOWNS

I lost track of time today had the best day ever
To lose it is to find it, splendid is its flavour
I thank God for the Sunashine in our lives
As seeds sprout, remember to enjoy life guys!

[Poet's Voice]
It's time to join my favourite pets in dreamland
As I think of my nephew playing in the sand
I love you guys, you're a great source of delight
Time to go sleep now, goodbye and goodnight
