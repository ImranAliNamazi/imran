My guru said - a significant stage of evolution is often marked
By a powerful recrudescence of all that has to go out of evolution
I see crud everywhere, and it's saddest still to see people polarized
By the news which only highlights all the wrong things while inciting

Us to say and do things that forever will keep us hell bound
I think Dan Goldberg said it beautifully in Tiger in the Well
He explains well how the powers that be deliberately stir our passions
Making us hate this or other atrocity that the other side commits

While actually both sides are filled with gentle, peace loving souls
There is no religion on Earth that hasnt contributed to the well of love
That we should feel for each other if we truly follow it's prophets
So I leave you, mad, mad world to yourself and I turn to my maker

<strong>With a Cry! Cry Peace! Mankind, I beg of you, do not be a puppet
We've so much beauty and love to offer as a species to one another
Yet we give into hating. I say, break the downward spiral quick
Before it engulfs us and makes us worse than the original fiction</strong>

Offer that olive branch. As salaam - may peace be upon you
Om shanti, shanti, shanti - may peace reign at the 3 worlds
God's peace and love! May love light the way for you mankind
Out of this darkness as you stand tall - creatures of the light
