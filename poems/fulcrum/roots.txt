10 women have come and gone and yet I dance alone
A poet's life is empty sometimes - I feel bankrupt
Fearful of dancing in the dark, under the full moon
I want to jump into the fray, like those who crept

Into each other's lives bringing a new joy unfounded
I've lived life joyously and with a carefree abandon
But lately I think about a girl I had befriended
In the days of our youth, the joys we together won

How I'd love to stop blowing with the scattered wind
Instead put down roots and live in the Inner Light
Like Picard did. Why did I leave those lovers behind
When I should have betrothed any one, found delight

As she watched me unfurl my timid sails and Play On
A friend with a silver tongue wished me good company 
But that ended in disaster, I have since willed my way on
But feel alone and empty most days, I sob feelingly

I'm not bold like before, when I had passion and fortune
5 brief years ago, I thought I had met the woman for me
Now I just plod on despairingly, my whistle not in tune
For my past and my future haunt me, when will I be free?
