I'm made of stern stuff - the mettle I have is old world
I may seem to be stretched to the point of breaking but
I'll survive no matter how much my heart and mind whirl
You see, the love I have for myself will survive any cut

I'm a good girl I am, loved by those who see to my depth
Not worried of a tomorrow when I know of God's love
Which will be as a grace bestowed, though I seem inept
My strength waits for the day it'll shine to the skies above

My back is to the wall, I'll come out strong and swinging
Placing a firm blow in all the places that seem to rob me
Of my rightful place in this wonderful world where I'd sing
Sing of future joys and sorrows, sing loudly and clearly

I'm a mother now you see, I gather strength for my son
So that he can dance in the sunlight, find his way too
We're a simple folk, firm as bedrock is our faith in the One
Who will show us a way, help us bid our past a firm adieu

Enough hurt over there, its time to live a brand new life
The Angel's bear witness to the warrior blood inside me
I know the ways are steep, but I'm no stranger to strife
I'll keep moving along until I've build a life oh so perfectly
