Learning to bicycle was a joy to surpass all joys
I grew up fast, enchanted by my books and toys
I saw the world through the loving eyes of the Buddha
Safe I felt as I contemplated the Lord's bounties with awe

<strong>My teachers pushed me hard until I came into my own
I work tirelessly to make YieldMore a thing of renown
I learnt to take the cuts and bruises in stride as they came
Until one day, a catastrophe hit, leaving me bent and lame</strong>

Luckily I had the love of those around who nurtured me
Helped me cast of the shroud of things never meant to be
I look at people with eyes brimming with compassion
For I know pain first hand, hence to help, the passion

Now I delight that I have a younger brother to look after
He believes we should strive to win gold in the hereafter
He's the bard of the family, a jagat kula or world family
He wants people to tell their tales, oh so spontaneously

We've much ground to cover, life sentences to serve
I show him now and then to face life or to swerve
Where the road goes I know not but I aim to have fun
While serving the grand design, splendid as the rising sun
