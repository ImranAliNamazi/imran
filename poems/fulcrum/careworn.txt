I feel frail, worn and beaten and know not the way
I used to talk lots, but lately I haven't much to say
What good amidst these O me, O life - I'm spent
Will I ever have the will to fight and not be bent

Beyond repair. I know not the next step to take
So many paths to choose, so many a mistake
So what am I - a man with a family to look out for
Who dreams of waking the world from its stupor

The family watches as the world plods on without a dent
I haven't done a thing for either, and yet I say I'm spent
The good fight goes on and I watch thinking I'm there
In the middle, shadowing my heroes' moves with flair

<strong>Time to stop making the same mistake of escaping
From reality - superheroes sometimes need helping
Especially when their powers aren't battle tested yet
Will I rise to the occasion, or continue to sit and fret</strong>

I'm no longer worn, I feel I must be steady and patient
Life is what we make of it, so we must go on, prudent
And confident that we are on the right path. Become
The flame - the time to win the Kingdom is come!
