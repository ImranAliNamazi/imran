As mankind's saviour George Carlin said, we are a war like people
I believe that we need to tone down our language, exert our will
Stop making war games where the objective is to "frag" someone
Instead think of rainbows and unicorns *1, teach our children *2 wholesome fun

There's the three gunas *3 at play and not enough sattwa or illumination
I've had enough or war, seen too many nations bombed to utter destruction
How I would love to lead a revolution by pacifists and ahimsa *4 devotees
Will you fellows put down the guns - real and virtual too - oh pullleaze!

I saw that war being raged - it was a Robin Williams' movie *5 from the 90s
It spoke of a toy company being overrun by war mongering power-crazies
I don't know how to end this war that reduces us to sub-human standards
Sometimes we need to Turn the Page *6, stop destroying with bomb shards

I like Richard who rebuilt the universe *7 without malevolence
How Avedoi Merek brought back a civilization to its inner sense
There is no timeless philosophy that prescribes hate over love
Time we extended the olive branch and let loose the inner turtle dove

I courageously hope that we can put our bloody past behind us
That we can live in God's light, peace and love, stop making a fuss
For within the human heart is the divine spark of the creator
Time to fulfill destiny, overflow with joy and warm, tender banter
