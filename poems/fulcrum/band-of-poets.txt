I joined a group of people - we all shared one thing in common
'Twas a love of words, words that spoke to a body's heart
We drenched ourselves in poetry for that fueled our imagination
We'd speak of the human condition - this dialogue was our art

[Rest of Group Joins]

We express our feelings through words - that hits everyone's heart
We put our imagination on paper - that gives our audience a new insight
Our imagination exceeds the limitations of time,
However soon those feelings combine!

// Lying down I thought about the words of these strangers 
My unsaid words captured in a beautiful rhyme, 
Oh how the strangers spoke to me in their silent voices
To an abandoned house, poetry is like a pretty wind chime //

(Like stars in the sky and the dance of fireflies... 
Our words shone, lighting the dungeons of our hearts bright
Tugging at the unknown parts of our mind's eye, 
Our feelings and emotions marched ahead into the mystery land, guided by a magical sprite!)

Under this roof, we don't shy of our trapped emotions
Drenching in each other's tears, we help ourselves overcome our fears
With paper and ink, in varied shades and tones
We, the artists swim in poetry, an art of our own
