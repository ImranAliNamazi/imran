Our daddies said to do what we did - to do it well boy,
To have faith in our ability in a world of opportunity.
We get into a working rhythm, not treat life like a toy,
Trust in each other to carry the day, deny mediocrity.

Instead be stellar in our efforts to win over customers
Adding value to their businesses, as only we know best.
We delight them with our thinking skill - not cut corners
Because we let our ethos and integrity be put to the test.

We stand apart in our promise to deliver a high standard
Of quality, we work hard to give what we said we would.
We're quick to support a colleague, we're never wayward
Instead our concern for living beings touches as it should.

Sensitive to the world and it's problems, we aim to serve
Giving more than we take, covering each other gently.
We aim to set a precedent for concern, we do not swerve
Instead we excel at showing kindness to all and sundry.

I look to merge my ideas for work and humanity at once,
Ensure I give my best to all my friends and family as well.
I look at my dark past and know that I have been a dunce,
But hey, I'm sure there's enough love to make life swell.
