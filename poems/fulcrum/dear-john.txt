When we were young, the music filled us with life
Sadly it's taken on a somber tone now, ah, such strife
It seems just yesterday we'd rehearse for shows
When Dragonfly played, I'd be in the front rows

We've plenty of good memories John, mon ami
I've seen you grow into a wonderful guy, dear to me
We've watched the moon wax and set out upon the road
Why don't we talk now, let me help lighten your load

If I can at all, for its usually you advising me on life
A thing I oft struggle with, a problem that is rife
I hope you pull through this rather difficult time
That someday we cleanse off the mud and grime

For life is tough but you, you handle it all so well
Make me forget my own sadness, instead feel swell
I know you're withdrawn now and very very sad
If anyone went through the same, why they'd go mad

Remember all the lives you've touched and be strong
Or break down as you need, heal yourself with song
There's much grieving to be done, I hope life will allow
Your wishes to come true, then bright will be the morrow
