We have a priest whose *discombobulated* - he's very confusing
But he's sweet - he exhorts us to taste the *peaches* along the way
They say we're *free* to choose any life - so let's dance and sing
As we *search* for joy and happiness in our future and every day

Peaches are wholesome and healthy, but we enjoy *snickers* too
So we're a little *ambivalent* about what's the best food to ingest
But we hope to create the right *ethos* in our home and invite you
Into our lives, though you may find us *capricious* - we give our best

They say to ride the ups and downs of life with poise - we're *exuberant*
now, but we don't know what tomorrow will bring - perhaps *solitude*
These emotions are *symbolic* of our inner spirit - we're lady and gent
Totally *symbiant*, always ready to give our best - kindly and never rude

When at peace with the rhythm of life, we find a wonderful *radiance*
We know its ins and outs - in tune with it's *parlance*, and then we find
A strong connect our wonderful *souls* joyful as we sing and dance
Our paths *clear*, we live for fun but also to serve - our paths intertwined

We start life by singing *supercalifragilistic expialidocious*, and enter into
A wonderous phase of our lives, everything sweet and poetic, we move
Along effortlessly, our spirit strong, endearing and infectious - we find new
direction amongst competing devotions. We leave you now to find our groove

*Discombobulated*
I ain't feeling this
It's only making me frustrated
They tried to sell me this life 
They said it's all *peaches* and cream 
But they didn't say we were *free* to dream 
I wanted not but to *search* for signs of love
Amongst the churlish *snickers* of men
*Ambivalent* to my approach was humanity 
My *ethos* being my only sanity 
*Capricious* and maligned were they 
To my *exuberant* devotion 
I had no choice but to take comfort in my *solitude*
*Symbolic*, meaningless, solitude 
The *symbiant* in me is alive somewhere 
In a parallel world full of *radiance*
Love and only love is the *parlance*
The purity of my *soul*, be my payment 
*Clear* my pain in the hereafter 

*Supercalafragiliaticespiallidocious,*
Judging, calculated, atrocious
My stars donâ€™t align with any ones 
There is no hope for the outcast 
Except for a fellow outcast
I may be alive today only in suffering 
My mind wanders days, just buffering
I will not be who I am meant to be 
I am only what I am, when I choose to be.

Heavenly Dance

We came here discombobulated
The smell of peaches entranced us
We saw free in each other
Search for answers left us
Enjoined in Snickers and sweets
We snacked feeling free
Ambivalence had entrapped us
Our ethos to be seen

Capricious hearts singing wistful
Exuberant we exclaim
In Solitude we capture:
Symbolic is our love
Symbiotic we are in ease
Radiant and enraptured
Parlance how we speak

Two souls enjoined exclaiming passionately
Clear as day
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
