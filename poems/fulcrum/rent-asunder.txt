Today my world came crashing down around me
Seems my silly eccentricities caused grief to Thee
You loved me unconditionally but I forgot to tell
That I live stifled in a cave, my soul beat pell mell

Annai, the cords are cleaved, this song bird now free
What a joy you've been, how much I learnt from Thee
You taught me to love myself and trust my own voice
A voice that begs us to be kind amidst the noise

Enough of me now, last xmas you rent my heart asunder
As I learnt of your grief while you thought I didn't bother
It's hard to see the pain that 15 months have brought you
When instead I thought you'd found roses out in the dew

I find it easy to talk of myself but that doesn't mean
I'm selfish, I just dunno how not to moan and whine
I forget to listen for cues that your heart is grieving
At the injustice for which you wonder at the meaning

You've shown me love and now its my turn to tell you
That I'll always be at your side, so try not to be blue
Life is tough sometimes - but in my heart you are king
Though this selfish world has robbed you of everything!
