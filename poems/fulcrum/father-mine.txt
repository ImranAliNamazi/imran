Father mine, yesterday I held you to my bosom
The day before you held me as I took my first step
It seems now I'd forgotten the sound of your voice
I do remember driving around town on various work

How you kept yourself busily immersed in action
And how sometimes we'd yell at each other with force
But no force or stupid word ever stopped us loving
In our own ways - each other and this beautiful life

We've both tried to serve humanity to the fullest full
I wish I'd had more time to absorb your resplendence
Perhaps the biggest lessons of all you're yet to share
As from behind the veil you guide my every care

<strong>Father mine, I do remember your gentleness and poise
It's time for me to take up the slack, find my own voice
I'll look for a sliver of you everywhere in all that I do
Help others as you did, keep them from feeling blue</strong>

I've been an overgrown baby I know it's time to grow
Perhaps its better this way for now I'm mindful of you
There's a beautiful life out there to embrace with a glow
Now that you are in my heart, I'll never again be blue
