All things bright and beautiful all teachers great and small
There you are my brother Siddharth teaching, standing tall
We're a special breed with so much wisdom and love
We treasure our children as we plant seeds in their grove

Seeds that will sprout someday as they come into their own
We teach them to be bold in life, smile instead of frown
We don't protect them from sorrow, we make them strong
We teach them to dance, be proud of where they belong

Parents teach too in their own special way, it's just
They don't enjoy the love of a bagful of kids who must
Squeal and howl and jump up and down as they're taught
To be good to neighbours, ultimately follow their heart

Teachers respond best to children whose heart is pure
They know what to say, how to make them feel so dear
I know teachers who inspire long after the child is gone
From the classroom - their memory splendid as the dawn

I was lucky my teachers inspired me to give my best
To pay it forward as in turn my kids are put to the test
When I think back to school I feel with much delight
That I should go hug teacher X with all of my might
