I swear by God, I see us all united in the bosom of God
But I was asked to despise my brother, isn't that odd
They keep driving the rift between us, till we want to kill
But brother, I see you no different, can't we see God's will

He wants us to love one another, be our best selves
Not be distant, and keep our hearts on the shelves
I'm no different from you except for colour or tongue
Stop me before I do something exceedingly dumb

Like laying down my gun and embracing you tightly
Our mothers will be happy to see us laugh again so lightly
As we rout out the bad blood that's festered for decades
Time to plant the seed of love, show it in spades

<strong>We've been through conflict and done horrible things
Time mends all if we stop fighting, give our dreams wings
I'm sure if we introduced our children they bond quicker
Children know not the woeful stories that rent us asunder</strong>

Find someone across the border and say you love them
You may do it this moment, though I didn't say when :)
Tell a story that made you think of the wonder of life
Embrace them as long lost, come on let's have no strife
