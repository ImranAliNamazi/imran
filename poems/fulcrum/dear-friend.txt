Dear Friend, I hope this birthday finds you in good cheer
That your content to once again be on the threshing floor
Where the Lord distils the essence of what it is to be you
Preparing you for next year, keeping you from being blue

Dear Friend, the road leads over the mountain and into
The valley, so walk the path with pleasure and keep to
The side that brings you peace and utter contentment
Help the elderly along, walking still but somewhat bent

<strong>Dear Friend, enjoy the company of family as you walk
And that band of friends who love you so, so talk
To us and remind us of the beauty there is in life
Soothe our hearts with your voice that negates strife</strong>

Dear Friend, rest assured you are special beyond measure
You've to become a healer now, so find that treasure
Where you come into your own, healing with a word
Heal the sick, the weary, the hurt, why even the bored

Dear Friend, you've been good to me all these years
You've seen me laugh, comforted me when in tears
Remember to call loudly if ever you're overwhelmed
By life, for thats what friends are for - so MEND
