I'm a content architect, I work with information for a living
I tire of it's use for business gain, my heart is more giving
I dream of a way to engineer a way out of humanities mess
When we will start living in harmony instead of a life of cess

To a country, the services it provides it's citizens is all important
Also their bonding with others - in this my belief is adamant
We need to look beyond the daily problems, niggles and chores
Sit and pull in a brighter future, to it open up our doors

Can technology help? A million times, yes but is that our intention
Or are we fated to use it to divvy up the loot and exploit a whole nation?
Humankind, weigh your actions carefully with the metre of your conscience
Your children are watching, hoping you wont disappoint with lack of sense

Everyone knows love and only love is the best show in town
Love much, laugh often, and I promise you'll never frown
Think of transparency, mutual good will and sincerity as paramount
And imagine if technology could in this serve as our mount

Our faithful horse who aids it's master to serve society well
I pray for that day - when sites and apps will goodness sell
Country roads, a place where we go to feel that spirit of oneness
Where civil servants, companies and charities transform worldly mess
