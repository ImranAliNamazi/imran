It's hard to see loved ones find a partner and then brood
Because this or other difference came in the way
It's harder when I see them part ways, isn't it understood
That everything doesn't happen as we think and say

It may be hard to explain the dynamics, but a lot is just
Nonsensical baggage from lives previous and our youth
I don't mean for you to change your mind, but trust
Your intuition and find and follow that which is your truth

The heightened expectations makes the pain hard to bear
When your partner does cruel and callous things to you
Sometimes it's best to just talk it out and clear the air
A break may bring you to treasure moments left, so few

Sometimes a permanent parting of ways is needed
I only hope this is handled with maturity and dignity
Whatever fate has in store I hope to see you mended
Love yourself more, for that will truly set you free

So many of my friends are going through so much pain
It's difficult to watch them bottle it all up in silence
I was implored yesterday to be a part of your life again
So talk to me please and let prevail your resilience
