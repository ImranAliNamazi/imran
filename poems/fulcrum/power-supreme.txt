Master and Miss Divine, grant me power to meet my need
Help me share it with others, help them shift their greed
Into a force for good, as we band together in the fight
The good fight that we join valiantly with all our might

Turn my calamities into a calming moment by Your grace
Teach me to overcome obstacles, this world to face
Fill me with divine virtues as I follow my own heroes
Take me to gardens where I recoup and smell a rose

I am told that one must become the change he wants
I stray off the path often, this world at times me daunts
Then You set a string of events to remind me of my duty
To do noble deeds, find those who need help to be free

<strong>And live in the light of Divine love, as you once taught me
We need band together and serve as we go about boldly
On the journey of life, serving You, our maker adroitly
There's much work to be done - we still need to do plenty</strong>

To establish Your kingdom here on Earth, we are tasked
In all our efforts we must go our utmost crazy fast
Our systems and constructs are collapsing on every side
As we realize more strongly, the divine that dwells inside
