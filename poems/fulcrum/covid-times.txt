As any calamity does, the corona virus has brought us closer
There's always cruel opportunists but of them, dont bother
A stark terror bubbles beneath at whom next it might take
But on the whole, we learn to value life, not waste in any mistake

We're done with the old ways of utter callousness and unfeeling
Being cooped at home, we've gotten past crazy and begun healing
It's a little rough but we're now starting to appreciate family
There's been friction but we learn to enjoy the other's gaiety

I'm a little careless now for I have had a taste of a social life
The stark terror comes and goes, but it's time to play the fife
As we realize death is not a final parting and we become nicer
To those around who make life special, in that I am now wiser

This work from home is taking its toll on some but atleast hey
We're spending time with our kids, beaming more each day
As we realize what was missing - quality time spent at home
We're more in tune with that inner spirit, we even chant an Om

I'm sure that many of you will agree, life is what we make of it
So dont waste time, if you have a dream - go apply your wit
It's tough times, so become tough and get going, be inventive
Remember whats was asked of us - to sing and dance and live!
