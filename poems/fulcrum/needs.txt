So many gods, so many creeds
So many paths that wind and wind
While just the art of being kind
Is all the sad world needs

I swear to thee, this above all
We need to learn to stand tall
For this world needs giants again
People who serve with no thought for gain

Standing at the hilltop
Don't you dare cry
The wholesomely blue sky
Is always there to fly

The hilltop might not be your destination
For you're meant to have satisfaction
You might be attached to your distraction
For you are still under construction

Never give up so early
Everyone watching you eagarly
You will definitely come back strongly
Just think positively
You are doing everything perfectly
