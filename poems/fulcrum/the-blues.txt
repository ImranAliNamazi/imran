There's a kid I know, cried while our blues played out
Watched his momma squeal, wonders how she'll heal
I pray he finds his grounding and firmly puts out
Our predilection for madness, instead heads Vidzeal

You see, he brings the Zeal to the equation, helps a body
While his mother brings a learning of the subtle energies
Together they help people find a way out of any malady
That wisdom or Vidya is her gift to times such as these

We've all still got the blues as we wish for other times
We're so sure the energies we have for now are broken
I know that time and perspective set right most things
I pray that to new perceptions your mind will hearken

Come on momma, don't fret or baulk at the work ahead
We're healers remember, learning to earn our stars
Dig within and pull up a fount of resilience - wear red
As warriors do, but mix them with blue, hum Neel's bars

Too. Remember red and blue are the mark of the survivor
You two youngsters who weave the necklace of the suns
By your yoga, you may feel put through  the wringer
But your heart embraces trustingly, so be blessed ones
