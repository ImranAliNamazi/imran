I left this world today, a world full of loved ones
I wish I could tarry here, I love you all tonnes
But I'm with my Maker now, where reigns peace
I wish you well as you navigate the Earth and seas

I've seen many a happy time pass by in my day
Also tough times came but I didn't lose my way
Faith in my Maker helped me overcome it all
Look at life as a gift, and you will have a ball

Why speak of balls now you may very well ask
Grieve not, for I have poisefully done my task
I'm with my Maker now, looking upon you expectantly
Wondering when you will this gift of life truly see

Fear not to embrace death for its only a gateway
To the hearafter, to where loved ones have gone away 
With our Maker now, we wish you would calmly quell
This fear of Death - remember the soul is eternal

Know life as wondrous, full of it's ups and downs
Be inspired to live in the memory of loved ones
Our Maker you will join one day, so try and find
Your rhythm in this life - just quieten the mind
