Sometimes life has us devastated for we lose someone near
We're teary eyed as we think of all that made them very dear
It's especially hard when it's a parent made harder for often
There's a lot of things unsaid or in haste, unkind words spoken

As they say, it seems a river of time ceases to flow upon a death
It's very painful when the memories leave us gasping for breath
It takes time for the grief to subside and we remember the good
As we plod on wearily, often dark thoughts affecting our mood

Then finally we come to terms with the loss, feel at peace
Attached to the memories we are, but gotten a new lease
For we've forgiven and been forgiven and realize that now
Their perfection was a seed that's finally starting to grow

Friend, I dont know how exactly it was with your mother
I think of the love I have for mine and begin to shudder
At the thought of losing her, a loss I know I cannot bear
Then sense your grief and gasp like a fish out in the air

When I lost my father a friend said: "May the tears of pain
and joy mingle to your toes". Until... you find once again
The will to face life without the mind zapping sorrow
More heedful of the precious moments we borrow
