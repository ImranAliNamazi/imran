Some of us show signs of wear and tear more easily
Some of us are convinced we live in another reality
Some of us are easily misunderstood and get angry
Some of us are sensitive to others who live unhappily

They say the Earth is going through an evolutionary crisis
Our morality is at extremes, some counter peace with ISIS
Some cannot cope, deal in dope to get their daily fixes
Sensitives say we need to love abundantly, nod with yeses

Are we truly the crown of creation, at that I really wonder 
Are we gentle with Mother Nature, show love to her
Are we to treat criminals more gently, we should ensure
They reform quick. Sensitives say yes indeed, hear hear!

Must we do some deep soul searching and find our swing
Must we help each other and be good above everything
Must we forgive past hurts, find that special something
That touches lives. Sensitives say yes a 1000 times, so sing!

<strong>Can we aspire to be godly, reach for heaven all the while
Can we uplift anyone, help them walk another mile
Can we say each day, we did everything worthwhile
Sensitives say we surely must, now go make someone smile!</strong>
