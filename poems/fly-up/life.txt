Life is short
Live it well
Loved ones depart
Savour the memories

We all grieve
Support each other
Time will heal
Only if you let it

Give into your emotions
Feel the texture of each one
Give thought to your maker
Be good to yourself

Life is short
Make it tenable for others
Take a page from a heroes book
Find inspiration however hard the times

Remember a moment of joy
Remember a moment of sadness
Remember a moment of strife
Remember a moment you LIVED
