Hey boyo, I long to be in your wonderful arms again
Where I feel safe, the madness of the world distant
Can we go to a remote island? Just say when
And ill be there at your side, joyous and expectant

What love we shared was the best I knew for I felt it
Your tender lips made my knees go utterly weak
We'll be together again, for that future ill be fit
And ready to once again be at my lovable peak

I think back to our days and wonder at its beauty
How we danced on and spoke of building a haven
When every verse you wrote, you wrote for me
Living at your side made me feel young again

Busy you are with your work but think about me
And all the good times we spent in total bliss
Surrounded by a love that emanated from thee
Just pick up the phone and give me a lingering kiss

I find the world cold without your warmth next to me
So come back and lets again make the world better
Stay beside me, make me laugh and sing out with glee
Say forever and ill feel elated at the thought of being together
