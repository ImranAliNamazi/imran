Mothers Love, 20th Feb 2020, for Uma

It's not uncommon, but sometimes rare
To find a mother so filled with care
I wonder what I did to deserve her
My mother who'se calm in any weather

I've seen a few doting mothers look after
Their children, for then they'd enjoy the hereafter
For they've lived true to their conscience
Following that inner voice, filled with sense

We're fortunate to have their endless love
They keep planting good deeds in life's grove
I'm saddened for those who feel the hurt
Of a callous mother, so often brusque or curt

If only I made for myself a wonderful life
My mother would be ecstatic to see no strife
Rather a strong sense of self with which to glide
Through this garden of Eden as a child down a slide

All my life she's been a guiding influence for good
When sad, her melody has brightened my mood
I wonder what on Earth I'll ever do without her
Me the apple of her eye, she, certainly my tether
