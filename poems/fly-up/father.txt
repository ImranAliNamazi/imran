Father, 13th Oct, Imran

There's nothing for me to do except live upto your shoes
Shoes you wore almighty well, in good weather and bad
Tell me the secret how you smiled amidst all your woes
Tell me fast, uplift me from my state of absolutely sad

Or has the sadness abated with the thought of your smile
Seems your warmth shines on us loved ones from above
Have 3 months really passed? What did I do all this while
I wonder what you thought when I spoke of being in love

I have eternity to ponder what went on in your mind
As every other moment a fragment of you comes back
And I think of you, so dearly loved for being ever so kind
So bend down gently and give me a resounding smack

For failing to smile and not daring to win the kingdom
As you did so certainly, a little more each passing day
As you discovered a little more of your innate wisdom
Do help me from above, it seems often I lose my way

I have highs to relieve the occasional mind zapping lows
Heaven knows I try and make you proud of me your son
Storms come and go, and your memory so softly blows
Maybe I'll find I've succeeded too when my race is run
