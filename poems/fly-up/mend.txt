I'm coming home I've done my time away from you
I've been sad and lost but still the days wore on
Now I'm focused, laser sharp, I'll no more be blue
Happy and activity ridden I'll strive until I've won

A 100 different ideas to work on, in flow state I'll be
Ever from this moment, without any worry or doubt
I thought of all my paper children and now I see
That they'll be fine alongside what's happening without

You said once my decisions shouldn't be forced
I've taken my time and reached some conclusions
To make it big, 2 Cr pa should someday be reached
Time to just own the game, no time for delusions

That's 10 lakhs a year for 20 people, theres lives at stake
No compromise on values or what we bring to the table
Let's pick up the pieces of our lives though it seems bleak
If I follow the voice within, it should all be very doable

Just one long stream of activity until the summit won
No more irregularities in giving my uttermost best
I wonder when beside me you will once again run
But until then I'll just focus and think it all a test
