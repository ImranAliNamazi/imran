Niyat or Intention, 16 Dec, ianamazi

We all have the best intentions Lord so listen to us
We pray for our health, and mean more that just
A sound mind in a sound body, we mean for care
For the most fragile part of ourselves - our dreams

Teach us to nurture our dreams and give them wings
As we learn to live elated at the very many things
And ways in which you bestow your grace upon us
Teach us to be happy in life and never make a fuss

We ask for contentment even when we're confounded
At the upheavals of emotions that leave us spent
We feel despair to look at a world all confusing
With so many people being hurtful to each other

Give me strength lord to always do your bidding
While allowing mine heart to shout and sing
In praise to Thee who gives us our inmost desires
Help me face the world, content at your Plan unfolding

Lord, I beg you not to let me suffer loved ones unhappy
Keep my intentions to my fellow beings pristine
Calmness amidst the raging storms of life
As we all bow and welcome your Kingdom here on Earth
