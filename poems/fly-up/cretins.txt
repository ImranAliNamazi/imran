Honk when theres no need
Beat their wives to vent inadequacy
Leave litter in public places
We want the pure atma inside

You cheat in business deals
Exploit the poor, never tip
And always complain and tongue lash
We want you to smile and be at peace

You sow disinformation and monger war
Treat your employees like shit
Live petty, shallow, callous lives
We want you to smile and find peace

You spew hate and resent everything
Take it out on children and family
The room is happy when you leave
Where, how and when will you find peace

Think of your deeds and find latent goodness
Wake up and hasten to evolve
Not a day passes that we don't all
Pray you heal and find peace
