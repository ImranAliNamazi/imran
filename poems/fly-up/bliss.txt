Bliss, 21 Feb 2020, for Ananth R

Two lives ended in their infancy, 2 families shattered
Bliss took a holiday that day, the Divine Plan thwarted
Will tragedy overcome us all in the end, is there a hell
Or will we discover the flame imperishable, the soul immortal

I see the picture of that couple engulfed in bliss
Then know they're together, not taking death amiss
Where on this Earth they've incarnated again I do not know
But if we are kind to children everywhere, their seed we'll sow

The memory is dim as I think back 20 years to school
When a new friend I made, blissful, calm and cool
I knew not then I wouldn't see him again except on a bier
And I callously left before they lit his funeral pyre

A whole night we chanted for his victory over death
Wondering when our own death would rob us of breath
This poem is about a boy I know who had a heart of gold
Couldn't stand by and watch people fear to grow old

He could be in school now again on Earth, waiting patiently
For time to endow him with the skill to heal all and sundry
A healer who spreads bliss and cheer wherever he goes
A strong old soul, with the strength to heal all our woes
