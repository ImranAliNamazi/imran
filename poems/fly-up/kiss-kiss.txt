Kiss Kiss, 30 Nov - for L

Kissing you makes my heart soar like a dove
Holding you leaves my senses beyond bliss
Hug me tight let us our fantasies thus weave
Make love to me from sunrise to sunrise

Take my hand hold it to your bosom
Sunlight shine on us, forever and a day
Your scent reminds me of flowers in bloom
Flowers in a valley, let us to it find a way

I lie beside you as dawn comes a creeping
The sun's brilliance reminds me of your smile
I'm in throes of delight, my lips a quivering
At the thought of kissing you in a little while

Tenderly I wrap my arms around your waist
Slender, slender waist that has my attention
I kiss you from nose to toe in utmost haste
I long to hold you, its my life's utmost mission

Kiss kiss, I submit to your lips a quivering
As they reach out and find mine own lips
Whispering waters at river's edge gurgling
Dance for me baby, slowly move your hips
