Lonely - 10th Jan 2020 - for U

Ah, to love a man who makes my pulse quicken
Who'll love me till eternity, build for us a heaven
I keep dark thoughts at the door, trying not to despair
But am alone every night, crying to sleep in my armchair

I see someone crossing the street and wonder about him
Will he treat his lady right or hit her after a night of gin
He seems cute and as he passes me I look at his eyes
And wonder at the sorrow there, a past he can't disguise

The ships pass on into the night as most evenings they do
I'm so afraid to pour my heart out to only hear an adieu
That though some dates do cause my pulse to quicken
I think of my past and wonder will I be hurt again

Lonely is the feeling I have as I give a heart-wrenching sob
And wonder will ever a cute face stand out from the mob
And stay the course as I put him through the test of time
Peel off wall after wall of my defenses, find a love sublime

No more dark thoughts I promised myself this year
I will conjure in my minds eye a man strong and dear
I wait for him to come walking down the street
And dream of what if our two warm glances meet
