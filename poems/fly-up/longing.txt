Longing, 16 Sep, Imran

Oh darling, I love you so and long to live at your side
What a woman to have, one I'd love to be beside
Through thick and thin, let's let our love be a guide
Baby I love you so very tenderly, we can ride any tide

I dreamt of you once almost a decade ago
I have you in my life now, my hearts aglow
What seasons shall we weather, make love in snow
Kiss me gently, place you lips upon my brow

A lifetime of memories to slowly accumulate
I'm so in love with you honey, let's stay up late
Until 3 am each night, as we did on our first date
Crazily in love are we, each other's soul mate

Am I dreaming or have we found love that's eternal
Steal moments of pure joy we did through it all
Someday our children will learn to stand tall
For we'd have taught them to always have a ball

And bask in the sun of life's thousand little ways
Tell me we'll be together, now, forever and always
Elated am I with your love that has me in a daze
How much I love thee, let me count the ways!
