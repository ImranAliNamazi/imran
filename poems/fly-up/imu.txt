IMU, Sep 18th

In my life, I've loved them all, and now who do I most miss?
An uncle, a sister and a dear friend without who is no bliss
We fight with loved ones now and then, all of us very volatile
Then wonder what to do, for without talking it's been a while

In that time, the furthering of a good relationship is lost
I look back and wonder... whom do I miss the most
18 months, 3 months and 3 weeks, they do seem long
Each a missed opportunity, I hope to soon undo my wrong

Then there's bitterness as we look at all that was said
I say to you, forget the madness, look at me instead
I've just been ragged as were you my dear comrade
Come let's forget the past and with this moment, be glad

Sometimes memory is stubborn, don't give into it and be glum
Remember the good times and give me a handshake so warm
I long to know how you are doing and what can I do to repent
For you've been an angel in my life, from the very heavens sent

So come on dear uncle, sister, friend smile like you used to
Let's make new memories instead of this impasse due to
Our clinging to words not meant just an upset mood that day
I miss you, just call and let's find something beautiful to say
