The Ark, 22 Sep, Imran

The war between two worlds is on, it rages on
As two halves of me are split between two extremes
The one says dont give up till the golden pot is won
It's at the end of a hard life of slogging without ease

Theres one harder still that calls to break the bounds
No promise of gold though, no path trod to guide
Just me and my wits, to keep sparring more rounds
No promise of home, no lover with arms open wide

Two worlds of dreams both I've had since ages gone past
Why's it so hard to have you beside me to dream on
Instead of asking me to choose for fear Joyland wont last
When nothing is guaranteed except a fight won

With courage and hard work as from this earth we take
Our day's worth of wages, what matters the field
As long as I give my best and do my utmost to make
A home for two, with plenty more happiness to yield

So put your hand in mine, let's make dreams of gossamer
Where's that faith you had in me in this year gone past
Let's work until they manifest soon, perhaps in summer
As we build a life of plenty, a veritable ark built to last
