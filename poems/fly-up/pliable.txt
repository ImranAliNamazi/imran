Pliable, 2nd Feb 2020, for MSV

Sometimes we're given the grace of finding a mentor
Someone to guide us, make us become better
Robert had Vimala to learn full flowered music from
I have 2 principal mentors - guides to help me become

Something my mother can be proud of, a valiant son
Who cannot sleep at night unless he's touched someone
All I have to be is pliable at a well-wishers touch
Be thankful to the Lord for giving me so much

Love as I can carry for myself and my fellow man
Come sit with me beside the river, be human
And let go of your regrets for the time wasted
Rather resolve to win happiness before your dead

Its a blessing to have someone who cares for you
Life's slings and arrows don't make you too blue
Relax for a bit and make sure to make life worth while
Think of loved ones and light up the room with a smile

What else can I say except beg you to find from within
Your highest right, for then you'll spontaneously grin
Even if your battles are not going too well
You'll find magic and leave us cast in your spell
