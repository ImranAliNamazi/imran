I let the waves of emotion wash over me
I remember you Gizmo, cuddly as can be
A lifetime of memories you've given with love
As Spirit Guide, you gently watch over from above

My clothes basket will always make me break out in tears
Is it only a month since you went, after those many years
Unconditional love you gave, my rock, my love muffin
Constantly in my thoughts, I miss you so often

I can still feel your gentle head on my feet
And how you would stand cutely to eat
How you would lick me when I felt low
And when we walked, my heart would glow

Burrowing in blankets was your favourite pastime
Sneaking cozily into my arms during worktime
To remind me of the love emanating from you
Now without you beside me, I feel ever so blue

You were a sweet soul who loved everyone around
I think of you snoring, how I loved the sound
I remember you playing with the ballerina Tyrone
How you would sniff around, hunting on your own

I cry now when I think of those fifteen years we shared
How you so generously showed how deeply you cared
I believe your watching over me as tearfully I stand
At my altar, come hold me, lead me by the hand
