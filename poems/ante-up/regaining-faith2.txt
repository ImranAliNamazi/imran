250 - Regaining Faith - 11 Oct 2020

A week later dear brother, I'm still in a bind
I've plenty of ground to cover, my way to find
I'm not a very courageous person but this I know
You cool my heart, time to set a fire there all aglow

I'm touched by your concern - I broke down today
Then I thought of you urging me to find my way
I think of your patience when I guide another friend
I guess love is all that matters, so keep it till the end

I'm boggled by the enormity of all I want to achieve
I want to learn how to have a trick or two up my sleeve
The truth is I need to pause and go back to the start
Coz while I've a few ideas, they all lack true heart

For radiance - the head, heart and hands must unite
I move in fits and starts and fail to explode like dynamite
Like I've longed to for many years, for reasons unknown
So many winters have passed, so many seeds unsown

Time to up the ante and pass on to the next phase with ease
Time to submit to the Divine and let blossom inner peace
I beg for your grace, Lord and to stop these bouts of despair
I put my faith in you Lord and offer you my every care
