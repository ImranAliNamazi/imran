239 - Rainbow - 14 Aug 2020 - For Sundaram

Bless us both as we set out to build a world together
I've plenty of healing to do, shake off a lot of fear
It's long since I read the tale of Duffy and Sean
The memory is strong as I set out your trust to earn

2 men - hardy, valiant, strong and the best of friends
Who work very hard, not knowing how the tale ends
Will we win the gold at the end of the rainbow?
Or find the colours have faded to pale yellow?

Blessings we need for precarious is the balance
We've both been beat, suffering much under duress
But strength we take from each other as we find
Our style complements - we know the other's mind

I'm here to burn away the lies the world has thrust on you
Your here to make malleable the steel that shines through
So let's boldly set out to see just what it is we can do
To leave this world better, like a whiff of mountain dew

A company built on values like never seen before
That will spread good vibes from shore to shore
I think its time we woke up to the blessing we have
I.e each other, friend, comrade and healing salve
