Dear consultant, finally a place that values what you do
And helps your online team grow in leaps and bounds
Is your quality work steeped in principles, think a few
And tell us if you'd like to continue with us more rounds

Our mission is to build a Conscious Business immediately
Help us do this and together with our clients we'll flourish
What means Conscious? You may very well ask of me
We mean values and integrity that will help to nourish

We're a little picky about who we work with and work for
Theres plenty of people whose ethic is questionable
But give us a chance and we'll give you a fantastic hour
And another, which'll prove that we are rather capable

Good things take time to build that's what were told
Well we fret not at the labours ahead, but are enthused
Join us and together we'll be on task and rather bold
Not afraid to challenge norms when that's whats needed

A new age is dawning and its time to show character
So come join us as we find the perfect work ethic
Show them how to constantly strive for the better
Lets roll up our sleeves, do our best work and quick!
