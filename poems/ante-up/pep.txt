237 Pep - 9 Aug 2020 - For Shyam

Complain about the present and blame it on the past?
I'd like to find your inner child and kick its little ass*
There's so much we have, so many things we can do
Why do we ever feel so uninspired, lonely or blue?

Why is it we never teach our children how to be strong?
To face life's trials and find someone to whom to belong
Most of what saddens us is the thought of dying alone
Without someone to love, we only find we're down

Saddening is alternate careers that dont quite take flight
We long to find a work that let's us put in all our might
What can we do to find the pep to overcome challenges?
Is it in quiet moments that we build up our defenses?

Moments filled with emotion that strengthens us
Makes us want to cruise along with never any fuss
Remember the friends whom in this life you've had
The wonder of a shared moment- think and be glad

Live a little more tenaciously each day, say thank you
And make life full of energy instead of feeling blue
A little pep is all you need to get you through the day
Kiss yourself and remember all you've come to say
