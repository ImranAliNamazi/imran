201 Bless Me, 13th and 24th Mar 2020

Bless me father for I purport to build a field of dreams*
Where we heal the past and build a future, or so it seems
Purify my intentions, make it wholesome and sumptuous
Help me transcend my narrow self, make my needs less

I wish to serve, with arms wide, so grant me your grace
Help me find healing for those caught in the rat race
I say seems because the road doesn't seem clear yet
I keep treading water but all I've done is to get wet

Wherefrom will spring other like minded co creators
Who'll discover jointly a source of joy for all of us
Who'll together toil ceaselessly until the world is better
Help put aside our silly past where we had many a fetter

Let's throw the shackles away and spring forth gaily
Forget the nightmares - instead thank the Lord daily
For giving us a chance to work on the outcome
Tend to the sick, make someone's life more wholesome

I beg you not to keep me waiting, to let my toil begin
Fight the good fight, let the Rainbow Warriors win
It's time to ante up and kick in so let's all unite
Bring all our forces to bear, let dawn replace the night
