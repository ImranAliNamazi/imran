Now the world seems perfect again with you to talk to
I never quite got over you not being there beside me
Some friends make life something to look forward to
Don't ever go again and leave me despairing. Can we

Promise to colour each others lives again as once we did
It's sad to see the thread by which my mind hangs onto
Sanity. When the world marches on, it's motives hid
And theres pettiness everywhere, we need to do

Justice to this life. We've one shot at finding perfection
I found it in bits and pieces strewn around all over time
I remember 04, 09, 13, 15 and '19 with deep satisfaction
I remember the lulls in between, pauses in a gay chime

That serve to accentuate the elation we can feel in life
I hope we can all recharge from the springs and streams
And live inspired, in tune with nature and all wildlife
Fighting the good fight, chasing and winning our dreams

I come back now to you, friend, asking to make a start
Do keep in touch now and then. Do give life your all
Remember to do things joyously, give from the heart
If ever you're down, you just have to give me a call
