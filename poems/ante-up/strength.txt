244 Strength - 4 Sep 2020 - For Anusha

I take a look at you and the memories come rushing in
I hold your hand and find there's quiet amidst the din
You've been a rock in my life, mama you still do smile
I wonder how you find courage to fight another mile

I'm all torn up inside, I've cried so much my eyes are dry
The streaks they've left remind me of more tears I'll cry
Hold me again just once and tell me we will never part
More moments I cannot bear, let's go back to the start

When I was a child in your arms and you held me high
Why don't we live forever, our love growing upto the sky
I remember other loved ones who've fought unto the last
They never gave a single inch, but thats all in the past

Here and now we've precious moments in which to heal
Say your piece and with a kiss, our feelings we can seal
I'm torn apart as I think of moments when I've been gruff
Rough words I've said, I hope you can forgive me enough

I'm calmer now to face the end - hold me to you breast
And whisper that you have the strength to face the rest
I see clearly now, two angels coming to help you bid adieu
In your journeys hence, do remember our love for you
