236 My Love - 9 Aug 2020 - For F

My love, there's so many ways I long to say I love you
Won't you have me baby... keep me from feeling blue
I rock myself to sleep when your picture haunts me
Makes me dream of all we had together. Did you see

The longing in my eyes when we lay in bed together
Don't you know that's fire to ride any stormy weather
I feel a stroke of lightning reaching out to touch
Your face - perhaps I love you a little too much

It's only your photograph but the sparks still fly
As I think of the days when there was no you and I
Only a togetherness when our love was grand and tall
Tomorrow, I'll sleep better - for now I give you my all

My emotions are raw as I let myself dwell on our past
A past you filled so tenderly - my we really had a blast
I dont know reality anymore, you seem larger than life
My memory haunts me, like a musician blowing a fife

I dont know what I want of life, except to be in love
The hand of destiny that fits perfectly - just like a glove
I sense you won't come back - that I had best repair
And make sense of my life again, not wallow in despair
