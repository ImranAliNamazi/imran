204, The power is yours, 24th March 2020, with Abigail

We must go inwards, into our soul
Forsake the fleeting and bitterly cold
Protect others and let our energy shine
Feel warm and good - so utterly fine

With our manifold powers that truly combine,
We can help all of those who are on the line
Help is near, saith those with the healing touch
Have the courage to ask others to be your support crutch

Love springs from a deep well inside of me
To rain over all of the hearts of the Sea
I feel tender loving care for every last of Earth's creatures
Let us all join together and be the world's teachers

So shall it be done, let's build a life of plenty
We place the seeds of our souls and hearts gently.
Our mission has only begun, come join us as we walk
The sands of time pass swiftly, do try and beat the clock!

The time is now and now is the time
So build swiftly, a loving life sublime
Do not fret, the moment is prime
For all we have now is this lifetime
