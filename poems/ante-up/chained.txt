How I'd love to be chained to you for eternity
Help me live not only joyfully but utterly carefree
Every moment I long to be in your arms my love
Let our love bloom, serene beauty from up above

The thought of touching you makes me tingle all over
My heart skips a beat, my senses heightened, I shiver
The thrill of having you beside me is pure delight
Come kiss me tender, let me cradle you all night

Love me sweetheart, that's all I ask of you this day
Let our love run true, let our dreams hold sway
I fill my stream of happiness from your sweet smile
Let me hold you close to me, for a long, long while

There's plenty of things to do as life unfolds for us
Roads to travel, rivers to cross, living without fuss
For a while I've wanted to kiss you from head to toe
Hold me now, let me ignite your heart, make it glow

Let me take your hand gently, as our bodies intertwine
You are my rock of ages, amirtham or sensuous wine
I've found forever at your side, now come be mine
Lets build a haven, have children, make love sublime
