246 Warm - 10 Sep 2020 - For F

My dearest love, I long to live and breathe by your side
I await your decision, not knowing what would betide
I urge you to remember the days you were my bride
We had little, but there was plenty of warmth inside

As the days go by, they seem dark and my body weary
The thought that you won't come back has me panicky
Without you, life's a mess, my days bleak and dreary
Wont you come back, forgive a man for acting silly

It's you I want unto eternity, the woman of my dreams
I'd give anything to have you cradled in these arms
With time, we figured how to ride the chills and warms
Your love ignited me, our passions and your screams

I remember that hair falling gently on my forearm
I remember your lips tasting tingly and so warm
Where are you today? do you remember our farm?
Where we grew vegetables - the sun like a balm

How I miss those caresses that touched me so deep
When we made love all night instead of going to sleep
Come back quick, dont make me break down and weep
Its 4 am and here I am alone, dismally counting sheep
