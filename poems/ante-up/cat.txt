232 Cat, 1 Jul 2020, On Self

I was asked to be conscious of my surroundings today
And write about the feelings that I had when I went out
I saw a cat on the terrace - it made me want to stay
And pet it for a long, long time - I wanted to shout

With delight, for I love animals with all of my heart
And it was a really long time since I had gone outside
Quick and crisp, the thrill and elation hit me like a dart
Making me want to explore my innards and not to hide

For hiding I've been doing in sorrow and distaste
For life seems to have lost its colour and splendour
I think now, when shall I once again enjoy the taste
And look forward to each day with its soulful wonder

I know its easier said than done, but stay the course
Life yields its manifold rewards for those who stay true
So think how good things are, instead of being worse
Embrace the moment with its ever changing point of view

The moment is passed now, I seem back in my shell
But its memory makes me feel comfortable and warm
Am I doing fine? What is it that makes me feel well?
I think I will beseech you Lord, to keep me lithe and calm
