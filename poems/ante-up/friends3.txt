213 Friends, 15 Apr 2020, for Kavitha

I've made many friends in my long career as a reader
Seen good movies, had wonderful music to comfort
It's been a joyful life full of meaning, spent together
Warming conversations to guide my every effort

I see three kinds of success, society thinks work is all
To me, friends and the meaning they offer are the best
Personal success defines how we ride a stormy squall
We're at our best when convictions are put to the test

So when I think about it my heart leaps in delight
It seems I've found success for friends love me
I guess 2 out of 3 is good for this stage of the fight
Now to be happy with work, toil effortlessly

Stories really move me - it's been my pleasure to read
I hope to turn writer soon for then my readers shall meet
The characters on whom my imagination does feed
Let me get to writing, then you, my stories shall greet

This poem is for a dear friend of mine who begs go deep
For in silent contemplation life takes on a new meaning
I thank her for her words of wisdom from which I keep
Remembering that life is best lived with utmost feeling
