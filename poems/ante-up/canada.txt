233 Canada, 1 Jul 2020, for Ali

What about Canada, where beauty reigns supreme?
Has it taught us to be kind? How does the world seem?
In the eyes of a Canadian we must all seem uncouth.
Humanity take a page from her while still in our youth

Theres much beauty in this world so shake off the past
Full of it's painful memories that aren't meant to last
Live happy and contented, we're built to enjoy bliss
Seek eagerly high and low for that Infinite Radiant Is

The path may seem hard but its threshing you gently
Until you shine like a diamond, loving all abundantly
Gasp for breath as you see the beauty life offers
The secret is in your viewpoint so open your coffers

And drink from the stream of life as she gushes forth
Think of your life as Divine and live a daily rebirth
Perspective can make or break so view things in light
See everything as part of the whole, peaceful and bright

There are places that are perfectly restful to the weary
Your country makes one feel no longer dull or dreary
Canada, help us take a giant leap forward and dream
Show us boundless love, until in delight we scream
