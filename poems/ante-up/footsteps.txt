248 Footsteps - 27 Sep 2020 - for Uma

I hear those footsteps dimming in the distance
I didn't notice I've been hearing them all my life
My heart beats in tune with it I now do sense
Plod, plod, plod, there goes my father's wife

The mother who showed me the way through all
Whose a little somber now without her partner
Guided by her I am in all undertakings big and small
I wonder what she'll do without him for tether

Perhaps it's time to man up, take her by the hand
And lead the way full of my thoughts and emotions
I've caught up now and at her side I do stand
It's long since I cooled her heart, filled with silly notions

Which to her don't seem practical but mama I say
Grant a poet his place in dreaming of tomorrow
I should find people who like that dream so do pray
We lift our spirits and soar above this rabbit's burrow

Where we hide, denying the Divine full of our lusting
I wish this world would embrace the spirit of love
Let's breathe and wonder what each moment will bring
Uniting with nature, planting saplings in her grove
