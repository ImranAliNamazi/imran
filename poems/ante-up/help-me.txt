I know you well enough to know you're patient and kind
We know a little of what goes on in each other's mind
You fill the role of an honest, insightful well-wisher well
You've helped me come a ways out of my own little hell

When we met last year I was simply going too fast
You've helped me rethink my ideas so they can last
Sad I was when you told me I'm still on step zero
Harsh it is, when in your mind you're already a hero

But I shake the feelings of no confidence away slowly
To think the goal is unreachable is simply being silly
It takes some doing but hey, we're never given a gift
Without the power to make it come true. Let's lift

Our mood and strive harder than we ever did before
Watch patiently as our ship reaches the other shore
Help me friend, my dreams seem to elude me still
Push me so I can bolster my courage and go on until

The prize is won, the heavens shower us with grace
What that dream was I forget as I run the rat race
Time wears on and nothing ever gets done at all
But with help from you I know one day I'll stand tall
