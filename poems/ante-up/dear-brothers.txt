249 Dear Brothers - 4 Oct 2020

John, you always been a dear
How I wish you were here
Thanks for all the support you give
If I'm not my best self, do forgive

Yogesh, your concern touches deep
Memories of you guiding me I'd keep
Don't worry my troubles are gone
You lit a candle now watch me burn

Sundaram, patience has left a mark
I promise to stop stumbling in the dark
Let's build something special to last
With your push, I grow pretty fast!

Siddharth, you always leave me wordless
Without you I'd still be a darned mess
Gimme time to stop my synapses misfiring
Pray the Lord I'll shine like a diamond ring

Ali, you've seen to my depths and wept
Time to wonder into which dream I've crept
It's hard to know dream from reality
Time to open eyes and touch infinity
