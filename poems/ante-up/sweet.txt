It's been a while since we held each other in our arms
To have you, I'd do most anything and have no qualms
Fleeting is life, baby won't you be mine so we can glide
Through life together, ride both the storms and the tide

It's painful to recall how I've been abandoned before
Love is precious - it's what keeps me begging for more
I don't think I'd last a day without you at my side
Hold onto me dearie, smile and lift your arms wide

I've longed to kiss you tenderly, touch your hair
Don't keep me constantly waiting, come on, be fair
You know we complete each other in every way
Kiss me tight this instant, let's begin our foreplay

What I'd give to hold your hips and sway gently
Dance around the floor to a rhythmic old melody
Forget the past, forget the pain, just hold me close
Let me kiss you from your ankles to your nose

I must be silly to say I want another woman in my life
But it must be heaven to have one with no pain or strife
I think of you my knees go weak, my heart skips a beat
Tell me you'll love me forever, that you think I'm sweet
