Nani, its hardly been two months since you left me
In the vacuum filled with the echoes of your voice
I'm bewildered and confused by all I feel and see
How elegantly you went through life - with poise

I wonder at times will I ever gain your stature
As I look at my kids and wonder if I'll measure up
Uncertainty heightens my love for every earthly creature
As we learn to drink your recipe for Amrit in our cup

The Amrit that grants us immortality as we live on
In the memory of our children and our families
The one's we think of, as we drive into the setting sun
Thinking back to a life that went - snap - like the breeze

Now that I have a perspective of how a life ought to be lived
I find myself gasping that I, of myself, did not more give
How can anything but a perfect, loving Earth be perceived.
Oh, won't you come back, dear Nani, and show me how to live

My friend tells me of a foolish life he spent - in much haste
And how he should have learnt temperance from the sages
He rues the times unloved, but me, I won't let any drop go waste
Of our wine which does overflow with a richness of the ages
