Kate says something about the flame too hot to handle
I guess that's why we took long years to let it cool off.
But now I think I'd like to go back to life in the girdle
Where we lived ensconced, darling please don't scoff

When you think of the ways I failed you in the past.
When we took communion together, I saw your face
And tender were my thoughts, I wanted it to last
So abide in my arms again, and let's jointly run the race

When I told another she was the 2nd prettiest woman
I knew, she laughed and said something in repartee
Had she known how cute you are, she'd understand
That's maybe the nicest thing I've told her, but hey

Now she's no more and I don't know that you'd have
Me again. That silly fellow who said silly things all
Those many years ago. I guess I just have to be brave.
It was a delight to burst in glee as when I did last call

But I'm a little more frail of heart these days, the pain
Has mingled so much in my blood I have no more
Strength to go on, unless you would have me again,
So dearie, let's get back and your love on me do pour
