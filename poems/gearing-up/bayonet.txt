He was sick of the darned bayonet. He had lost
A lot of folks to it. Both the wielder and their host.
Hell had vomited its hordes on him for the last time
Now time to turn the manure into daffodils sublime.

Enough of the dregs he said as he recoiled again
Will there never be a solution to make all of us sane?
Or are we all lost beyond redemption with no hope?
He wondered as he thought to just hang by a rope,

And end his life for he was still reeling from it all.
No time to waste on trivialities that seem rather small.
Win the kingdom or simply destroy everything in one go
He thought he knew the way, but how he doesn't know.

How to build an aircraft and rescue those he could
From the damn dogged pitfalls of fire and wood.
A time wasted on ungrates was all he saw, who clung
To rotting bodies, who from heaven had been flung.

The body is the temple of the Lord so be sure to make
Your offerings wholesome, a healthy thirst do slake.
I sincerely pray for peace for those warriors who wrest
With life as her very future lies in the balance, now rest!
