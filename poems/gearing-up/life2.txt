The journey of life is fraught with pain
We wonder what did we ever win or gain
The will to live dims with each dreary day
I've not much time but this I got to say

Be careful with life, she's a trickster and jester
Who'll cut you and laugh while you bleed, give her
Much forethought for in the depths of time
Is hid a sword that'll mute your every rhyme

Some say she's serene and beautiful
That's only when we've poise and luck. Dull
Are our days when there's nothing to live for
So be careful what you do, what you wish for

She's utter cruel at times but such is Adwaita
To know her pain is also to know her high - ya?
So try to dig deep for her buried treasure
She's nice... if you love her without measure

Sometimes our past seems like another world
But we've only to journey on, let our sails unfurl
Remember to plug away and pray for the best
She's only putting our steel to the test
