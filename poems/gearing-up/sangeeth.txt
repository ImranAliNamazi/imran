Dear Friend of my dearest friend how deeply I care for you two
Am thrilled to know about the home you two built together
Shake off the past with its maladies, it's time to see things anew
As you both set sail for far off lands, be each other's tether

Delightful is it to know you may follow in LR's footsteps
She, in the ripeness of time, has touched the lives of many
Remember to rise above the cycles of the days and its reps
See beyond to the age of divinity that comes, dream hard as any

Know that the grandeur of spirit is there to be found always
Amidst the mire, the muddy, the wilted, the vile and the miseries
It may seem we slide back, that life hits us and we lay in a daze
But fight back, guys give it your all, and soon you'll fly to the skies

I'm a simple man I am, humbled to one day be in your presence
I just came to know a little about you, I realize the magic you weave
In that family you made these past ten years, now let's knock sense
Into that sweet fellow whose life you've touched, give me leave

And I'll see that he rises to the challenge to excel in fatherly love
As our entire generation learns to find balance and inner poise
Now lay your head on him and let your dreams soar like a dove
Journey high among the stars - let the heavens ring with your voice
