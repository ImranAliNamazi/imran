We weather the elements each day, a little more worn
Conflicts here and there leaving our hearts torn
Smile when you see the boundlessness of God's grace
You'll come back to life, touch tenderly his Divine face

Moments come back to haunt us from the past
Moments when our step faltered, our mind at a loss
They won't come back so make sure you learn from them
Make your step more measured, Be calm and forgiving

Especially with yourself, for you are special beyond measure
So give life a chance, look out with wonder and take pleasure
In all that you do, know boundless and uttermost delight
Strive on until the kingdom is won by your toil and your might

Give life a chance I say again for she gives you her all
Smiles and tears, she teaches you to laugh and stand tall
The kingdom lays out there so come back to Delightful life
Throw all you cares away, fight brave and oust all strife

Dear Melissa, what can I say except to say that YOU CAN
Heal from the inside out, then you'll embrace life with Elan
Give us your best shot, we yearn for that day when you will own
The Healing space, and become a force for good, and of renown
