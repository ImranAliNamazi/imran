In old Indian thought there's a notion of modes of nature
Gunas they are called, and apply to every last creature
There's Sattwa or Illumination through which we win
The Kingdom of Heaven. Tamas makes our head spin

For it contains a darkness - the very force of ignorance
It's King / Queen are Time of whom I made a reference
In my poem Divine which I wrote some years ago
Rajas is the 3rd, its dynamism grows many an ego

Apart from these 3 modes, there are 4 aims in life
Dharma - law or truth, should indeed burn away strife
Artha - or meaning gives us pause to think and reflect
Kama, though needed, makes all our desires suspect

Moksha is release from the agony and the ecstasy
It calls for a certain poise that helps us break free
Not from any shackles, only barriers of the mind
We learn to be our utmost sensitive, caring and kind

That poise, or Equanimity of Chitta should be our goal
Which we wend towards constantly - it makes us whole
How are we to help the corporate world expand its thought
Find meaning for ALL - lest our civilization come to aught
