Dearest friend Manish, we let go of your body today
But the memories are ever real in our minds where they hold sway.
Your friends are grieving for the delight that you have been
And wonder at future joys that from behind the veil you will guide unseen.

There is no more powerful force on earth than love
Remember us as you journey back to the source, peaceful as a dove.
We shall look in on your family and renew our ties
But not be over sorrowful as most get when someone dies

I hope your return to the divine is a ride not bumpy
As you remember your time on earth, laugh at the times people made you feel grumpy.
All can be forgiven if only you look in your heart and feel,
One with the universe, sing out loud as we let each other heal.

My friend says they will remember you in their prayers constantly
That you were close to a few but your love was felt by many.
I know not your dreams but wonder when again you will incarnate
As I look for a sliver of all those departed, who'll learn not to hate.

You see the times are changing and we're here to establish the new
But it's grandeur and foundation in love can only be felt by a few.
I look forward to hearing of you from the loved ones you just left behind
Remember love survives death into eternity, as with each loss, we, this truth again find.
