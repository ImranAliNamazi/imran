Drops from heaven you come and dry me parched lips
I've waited all summer to hear your sloshy drips
Rain rain why don't you visit more dear rain
How I'd like to relive my youth say hello again

From the first instance I was so happy to see
The heavens burst, thunderclouds drum for me
Watching the lightning dance across the sky
Wonder in my soaking madness where you lie

When the skies are clear and dry the air
Wonder if I could find you and lay me bare
Your beauty as you splash and stir the Earth
Seeds germinate at your cue - they take birth

Oh Rain, you stir me to life, I beg  for more
I wax and wane on life's threshing floor
Waiting to unite as you trickle down slow
Down a mountain and make a valley grow

Oh rain wont you come again to me someday
I've waited for you to bring all to a state of play
Whilst I drink from a lake, it's you I revere
So do come back else I'll always know fear
