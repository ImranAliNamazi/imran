[To the Daughter]

I'm watching as you get your ears pierced
As I did for your brother some four years ago.
I wonder at what heaven you have conceived
As you become a salve, help us conquer our ego.

Cry in pain little girl as you grow and touch our soul.
Set upon this path of life, mixing tears with laughter,
You are a blessing indeed, you make our lives whole.
Be a source of delight by being foremost a daughter.

I love your parents dearly, they are a friend to many
As I hope in turn you will find people to care for.
Without well-wishers life can become a little weary
Wrest from life the utmost joy, let go your wild roar

I eat now as your family joyously requests me to,
I see your grandfather here taking care of the food.
I wonder at the journeys you'll have, taste a few
Drops of Amrit as you learn to cook and enjoin good.

[To the Father]

Bharath you are now called to continue the prayer
For your daughter, this life is so gleeful and amazing
I hope our paths will meet again in life's theater,
As we ride its ups and downs, enjoy gaily as we sing
