We Need Everyone to be Automagically Therapeutic
A poise and a grounding from which one can heal
I say pursue the subject of healing like a fanatic
It begins when you're in tune with what people feel

Some 50 years ago, Patch Adams set out to be
The best darned doctor that this world has seen
Not in the typical sense, rather one who can see
Beyond the physical, into the heart, a man keen

On lightening a patient's mood, healing with laughter
For what is laughter but a breaking of our melancholy
A grimness that leaves us unable to enjoy the day after
We think medicine men are to be thought of as Holy?

But they are human to a point, and in this is strength
As humans we share a deep compassion for the other
Willing to go that extra mile for love, why to any length
Love is what differentiates us from inanimate, Rather

Let's build a community of souls teeming with life
Who've long learnt that love is all we need to go on
Let the magic flow, dear girl, let blow your clarion fife
Do explore the healing in music, a splendour like dawn
