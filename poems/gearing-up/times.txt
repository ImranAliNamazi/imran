There's two times in my life. The time when I was with you
And the time when we will walk together again, softly glide
While your head lays on my shoulders - bonded like glue
Why don't you come back and live forever more at my side

In between these two times is a period spent totally inert
Inanimate, waiting for you to come back and turn the light on
Oh Pat, can't you hear me calling aloud, aren't you alert
To the frantic beating of my heart while my feet simply plod on

Not until the  next time will I cry all night for you I said
But I cry each night when I think of all the things we shared
Come back darling, let's walk down the aisle and be wed
Was it just yesterday we meant to each other the world, and cared

When you would say my name, your smile lit up my universe
I remember clarion clear your hands upon my cheek - clasping
As we set out to make Hermes and Aphrodite blush at our verse
I also remember fumbling in our excitement and some grasping

Can now enter a third time in my life when I let go the trove
Or memories as a thing now passed, however sharply they jar
And I come to terms with the present where may spring new love
Adieu Pat, I wish you well, for we travelled on the road quite far
