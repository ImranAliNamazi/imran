Ya know life wants to hold you
Maybe even scold you
For waiting so long
To know where u belong.

Oh life, why make me wait
In this messy, messy state.
Wondering what happiness is
Fretting and fuming with no bliss.

Life you belong in my memory
Where I savour your every story.
So let's ride along the open road
And have a stockpile stored

To treasure as in a jewel box.
Don't wait until fate knocks
Do build your destiny today
And let your dreams hold sway.

We are not here overlong
So sing out loud and strong.
Simply love each moment
Enjoyable like a torrent.
