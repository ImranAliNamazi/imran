This ship is battered and blown about by the wind.
It's mast needs an overhaul and so also it's engine.
I wonder if you'll keep her in dry dock tonight,
Of let her drift at sea and spin in maelstroms deadly.

She's been on a voyage of discovery, and gleaned
A treasure trove of insights about the bountiful ocean.
I don't know of your flaws but she's learnt of love,
So must encompass your frailty in her designs.

He adventures took her to the land of Lilliput,
Where gentle miniatures strove to quell a giant.
She's also been to Wickaeldroth and remembers
Well it's inhabitants Philip and Fritha. She speaks

In metaphors, and her memory goes back aeons
To when Mahakala was but an infant. But she's gentle,
And the caring emanates from her visage... and yet
You can see the bruises from storms weathered.

That ship is the vessel that is this cosmic body,
And she taps into the vibrations of every thought ever
Held in the mind of a sentient being. Be still this night,
And let her speak to you of lands bathed in magic.
