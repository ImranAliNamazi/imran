I say rokna - stop world and look at us in our prime
The ceremony of launching a new phase begins
This is the time of our life when we've a love sublime
Eternity stretches in front and we hope for wins

Stop world and wonder at the sight of us enchanted
Blessed we've been to find each other on the way
Promising to lead a life exemplified and undaunted
Excited as we hold each other and begin to sway

Stop world and guess at the journey that lies ahead
Auspicious days will come... and cloudy days too
But cherish them all we will as we're soon to be wed
Beginning, like you in wonderment, stuck, like glue

Stop world and think of the beauty of creation
Time flies and yet, her sweet embrace holds us
Bliss, now ours for the taking, fills us with elation
Embarking on a divine journey with no fuss

Stop world and know that we behold your beauty
Cheers to all our comrades for carrying us this far
Learn we do, of the richness that around we see
Loving you tenderly, we now wish upon a star
