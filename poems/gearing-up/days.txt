They say, "power to all our friends" - well, power to you
My dear, dear friend, look up at the sky so cloudy blue.
We never quite knew what meant a world full of light
But signed up for life anyhow, to be a source of delight.

The rest is silence they say, and life is indeed a gift,
Teaching us to be a force of love, if you get my drift.
Live exemplary my friend, think of all that touches
You - remember to feed the sparrows and thrushes.

The days go in a constant stream of ebbs and flows,
Now and then a zeppelin launches, on gentle bellows.
An old world tingly feel and we come back to our roots,
Wondering if we'll get to go, wearing our work boots.

The Divine Works that we were born to do, our purpose
To fulfil. Let the heavens burst and rain fall on us,
As we weave ourselves warmly into the tapestry of life.
Let you conch blow sweet and true, so also your fife.

Dazed we are from the spectacular beauty of existence.
Boys come and remind us of it's precious abundance.
Spend your time well snowboarding these templed hills
With poise, do enjoy the lows, and so also the thrills.
