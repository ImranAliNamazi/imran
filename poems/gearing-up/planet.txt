I tell you Remzi, the Kingdom can be manifest now,
If only people would listen to the voices inside
Where buried deep is the transcendent soul
And yet through it all, the sun does shine

As more people like you shine your truth on us.
9 years ago, I spoke of the loving movements
Than can transform our's to the Life Divine
Your's certainly is one such, so weave it well

Into the Fabric of this world, Her need is dire.
Enough of monarchs and fiefdoms which carve us,
Let's dance to Mother Earth's delight and become
The flame, for then indeed will life be beautiful,

Touching as in every interchange we show kindness
To those living beings around, for all are sentient.
Enough of corruption, here and now is the day when
Love unmanifest shall go out into the world,

And be manifest, binding us all together for, you see
The word was with God and it was Love, so ponder deep
The riddle of this world and become a force for good,
As giants emerge and pave the way for that Kingdom
