To Heaven let's put our unflinching sight.
As on life we focus our mastery and fight
For the truth that dawns as a splendid sun,
Inviting us to live illuminated, love everyone.

Bliss can be our's, it's the honey in our mouth.
Causes our redemption, helps us gleefully shout,
As we find the utmost secret hinted at in the Gita.
Will we deify women, rear them as Janaka did Sita?

If we cannot treat Mother Earth well, what are we?
Sub-human for sure, but for how long will we be?
A transitional being that heralds the New Race,
As we learn to love, tenderly touch Mother's face.

As Shakti would have us let go of our pained past.
Where hurt and heartache have caused a blast.
And left our hearts rent, but there's a promise of
Tomorrow where we can fill Amrit in our little cup.

So fight on dear lads, win a day of quiet truth.
Fight strong, but with compassion, do for our Youth
Who know not if a day will come, glorious as we dreamt.
When we decided to fight for good, and time well spent
