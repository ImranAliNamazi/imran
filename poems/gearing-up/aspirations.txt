I am lost in the mystery that is this magical Earth.
I idly ruminate on the past, a cup of tea at my Hearth.
I feel inanimate and sense I am becoming unraveled.
Lost all my aspirations for victories on roads untraveled.

I dreamt of a better world where beauty and truth reigned.
I think not of the fragrance that through this Lila He deigned.
I waken from this dull moment, my dreams rush to the fore.
Will these fueled aspirations fizzle out again like they did before?

I dare not wonder, I'm in the melee now - the thick of the fight.
I keep steeling myself at the thought of a tomorrow so bright.
As to amaze everyone - an outpouring of the force of humanity's love.
Let's set our aspirations and strivings to become like a turtle dove.

All clean on the inside and fresh and wholesome to the touch.
Oh, humanity - awaken - a brilliant destiny is not asking much.
Go with the flow if you must, but destine to cross to the other side.
Aspire to become Divine for then shall Angels by you abide.

In 10 short lines, if a body can reawaken to the joy that is boundless flight.
Think what victories can be won if to Heaven we put our unflinching sight.
Dream on my dears - think of winning the Kingdom this very day.
For there our aspirations merge and good deeds will hold sway.
