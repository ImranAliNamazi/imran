And they say that a hero does keep saving us and his name
Is daddy - he takes mighty tall strides and cuts a wide swathe.
This poem is for a dear friend of mine whose name is Bharath
He keeps on giving his all, and makes me feel glad to know him.

Stubborn in friendship, he's been a source of inspiration to us
And built a home in which young ones are a source of joy.
Lead on dear friend, teach us the meaning to love as we stumble
And find in the end, the path you trod can be as a beacon.

I wonder how this tale will progress as you push the envelope
Of what it means to raise children of the Kingdom and let them reign,
As sovereign inheritors of all that's good and wholesome on this Earth
Do keep gathering wisdom as you do and make us feel glad that you exist.

Keep us from tottering as you stem the tide of pain, and laugh as we fall
As you remind us of the pains you felt as you fell, then remembered to
Pick yourself up again and keep trudging on even in the dark.
For daylight shall soon come to one who keeps moving.

I'm not sure what I'm trying to say but friend know this...
We all feel a warm glow as you enter the room and greet us,
Go on doing stuff, show us the way to bliss, as you teach
Your children what it means for in life, to have a grand ball.
