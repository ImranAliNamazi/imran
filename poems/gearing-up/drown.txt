Let me drown in your laughter, splash in your arms?
Arms that rock my world, give spine tingling warms
When will our dance begin, when will we crescendo?
Dance into my heart, soon, and without much ado.

I've tried living these 38 years... or have I at all?
Come fill up my senses, keep me from feeling small.
The beating of my heart is a drum, lost and frail...
Find me in the woods, in a glen during a mighty gale.

Sunshine on my shoulders does make me smile,
Like the thought of walking you down an aisle.
Rain falling madly stirs me to life, cleanses my soul,
But it's only you, baby, who can make me feel whole.

Won't you throw down a line, help this poor man
Whose a drowning in a stormy sea.. Feels elan
At the thought of embracing you in his arms.
So come on lover, let's meet and ride the storms

I promise this one will go slow, so let the times roll
As down the promenade we go for another stroll.
Oh, please find me and let's set into the sunset
With sails high, making life as good as it can get.
