Perhaps meditation would have made me more considerate
And if I'd learnt humility before I wouldn't think I'm so great
It's a fine line we walk between self confidence and over-ego
We've gotta be ready to go wherever the road tells us to go

I am grateful for a loving family and for forgiving friends
I now walk boldly, wondering where the journey ends
Not always good to the world, I've had my own battles
I've been quite abominable, but when the dust settles

I'm quick to apologize for my being gruff and inamicable
Time to turn the page, contemplate values that are able
To turn us towards the light, where set ablaze is the spark
That keeps us shining, shows the way even in utter dark

I think of my adult life and wish with regret I'd been kinder
Instead of ever exploding at the slightest touch like tinder
I've now the courage to fess up and the conviction to tell
Kids not to fall into this or other trap, rather to cast a spell

And weave our best traits into a tapestry of the morrow
Where with no cause for regret or any tainting by sorrow
We instead build a unity as humanity demands it strongly
So fill yourself with divine virtues - do Her bidding gladly
