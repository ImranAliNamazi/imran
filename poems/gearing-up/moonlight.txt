Imran loves to talk, but somewhere in that talking he has
Discovered a joie de vivre and, because the universe listened
He also thinks he's found his calling. In an alter life, he was
Confused for a kid who wanted glory - but now he's rechristened

His mission to just simply loving - Having Fun & Touching Lives
We may spend and entire lifetime looking for love - but when we
Look outside, more often than not we may disappoint ourselves
Look at the mirror instead and see that child reflecting the light

In Joy and In Grace, we are each of us given a unique challenge to
Solve. A fresh perspective to find and to own, and once we see the
World as it truly is, we've the freedom to break free from confining
thoughts and action - reaction traps. Delightfully we come into our own

Reflecting the splendor of the cosmic scene. In the peace we gain,
we can find our heart's desire, for with that peace comes freedom.
Freedom to see the least of our dreams come full circle and joy
abounding and brimming forth from this newfound lease on life.

To share that joy and love with the outer world is our highest right
So, with gauntlet thrown, let's reinvent ourselves and live inspired.
Brooding days are over, but they remind us of the less than inspired
lives of the ones we may as yet touch, in our search for immortality.
