My friend tells me you have the most gentle eyes baba
That he sees a tranquility in them, though now shut
I dont know how the last year flew, I think of mama
And the time left until when she will leave too, but

Don't you see me weeping here, sorrowfully alone
I think of mine brothers my son will no longer know
And feel upset that they are callous and like stone
With no feelings, no thought that they stoop too low

It must hurt you two as in-fighting does all parents
Anyway enough of my brooding thoughts, it's been
A pleasure being a much loved son, I now look for vents
To take out all my frustration and hurt, be serene

So I can be like the pillar you were to mother dear
I wonder did you ever have differences of opinion
The past is hazy now, but, my conscience is clear
I done good, run my race like a thoroughbred stallion

I gasp now at the thought that the best part of life
Is over, that soon, I too will be pushing up daisies
Is there any meaning to life? We only know strife
But I guess the riddle solving is only for crazies
