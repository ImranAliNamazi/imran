As we go up and down on the giant wheel of life
The descents get ever fearsome for we know strife
It sucks our enthusiasm out until we're bone weary
We plod on step by step, forgetting to be merry

Tethers come to bring us back to Earth gently
We cling onto them, as they tell us ever so softly
What stern stuff we're made of, why we've woven
The necklace of the stars, watched Orome hunt Orion

I'm bounded to you my dear, but can't be tether
If you don't let me into your mind, let's together
Ride the rough bits until the times are a changed
And you're refilled with Amrit from heaven descended

I talk of Agape for mine is a love for all that consumes
Causes deep feelings for people that rise from the flames
So come back to life dearie, don't be distant, or sad
It's after all a beautiful life, don't let Her drive you mad!

So come sunup, I want you to look that luminary straight
In the eye and promise him your days will not go in waste
After all, what fun is life unless we have each other
As tether... So make a stand to uplift each other together
