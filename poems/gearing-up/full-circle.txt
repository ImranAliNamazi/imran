This is what I feel
Never really knew what I felt
Do I really know now?
Or is this just a test?

Who is testing who?
Is someone judging you?
Of what use are these feelings?
If we never see the truth 

We are born in ignorance 
Waiting for that something 
Something to light the fire 
Something to burn us down 

Rise we then from ashes 
But fall we shall to dust 
Have we come full circle? 
Is it time to rest?
