Chief - 3rd Aug - Satya P, Leaders

You still have a fresh beginner's mind O, chief
And you've built a community this city is proud of
Because you paid attention to the
interests and capabilities of your team

You're a perfectionist, who's ever striving
To help people rise out of mediocrity
You give your best because you want
The best for and from us

We're living in tough distasteful times
But you've navigated your ship through
With grievous losses in the still stormy sea
Yet you offer a salve with your humility

You delight to spend quality time with people
And your healthy perspective of life is a beacon
To those weather beaten sailors who are
The very salt of this Earth ??

Where else can I be, than to enjoy a ride alongside
As we tread as adventurers do and lay in tranquility
Amidst the raging storms and fires of our time
An act of submission that makes life worthwhile
