She is Uma and she's almost one with the spirit of Earth
She's timid and in pain and punchdrunk, has no mirth
No source of delight who can soothe her cares away
Her son neglects her, instead dreams of joining the fray

What fray you may ask? The freak show that is life!
Nowhere is peace found... we've instead bloody strife
He's been told a million times that charity begins at home
He's resented the principle but now learnt she feels worn

He immortalizes her by speaking of her in poetic verse
But will he change or be instead his silly, gruff and terse
He sees another unkind son and realises he's been in err
"What chasm of darkness must I cross to be beside her"

The distance between cities is not the source of worry
He's had a hateful past, now the reasons for seem blurry
They say our second life begins when we realize there's
Only one. So dare to be your best and think of your cares

And Niggles... and flow through them for time is fleeting
Soon the sands of time will run out and we'll be meeting
St. Peter who'll ask a 100 questions then entry deny us
So drop what your doing and show family LOVE not fuss
