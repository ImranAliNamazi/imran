[[Para 1]]

[To the tune of: Time]
 | And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but its sinking
 | Racing around to come up behind you again
 | The sun is the same in a relative way but your older
 | Shorter of breath - one day closer to death

And you flit and you flit to catch up with your dreams but they're fleeting
Realigning your creative juices is needed TODAY
Your dreams are the same but now your just more effective
Follow your breath - be sure to live before your death

[[Para 2]]

[To the tune of: High Hopes]
 | Steps taken forwards and sleepwalking back again
 | Dragged by the force of some inner tide
 | Our weary eyes still strayed the horizon
 | Go down this road we've been so many times

Mislaid ambitions crumble and bring you back to the moment
Staggering you reel from multiple blows
Bone weary you plod on wondering if you'll survive
Deconstruction is the very need of the hour

[[Para 3]]

[To the tune of: Part 3 - Another Brick In The Wall]
 | I dont need your arms around me
 | I dont need your drugs to calm me
 | I have seen the writing on the wall
 | Dont think I need anything at all

I want to break away all cages
I want to help people heal
I have thought of catalysing many a dream
Dont say it'll all come to aught

[[Para 4]]
[To the tune of: Take up thy stethoscope and walk]
 | Doctor doctor!
 | I'm in bed
 | Achin' head
 | Gold is lead
 | Choke on bread
 | Underfed
 | Gold is lead
 | Jesus bled
 | Pain is red

People People
Were brain dead
In a matrix...
Aching hearts
Mend away
Gold to hell
Pain can go
They have bled
Spirit is here
Seize... the... day

[[Para 5]]
[To the tune of: Sorrow]]
 | There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night
 | And there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
 | And silence that speaks so much louder than words
 | Of promises broken

Were made to constantly breeze through each others lives
No more surprises all is as we willed it tonight
In silence a truth speaks, whispering well
Of blankets uncovered
