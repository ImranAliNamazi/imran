How many people do we see around emotionally spent?
Do we pause and hear them, give them a place to vent?
Why is life so hard on those we hold as dear to us?
Can't everyone just chill and not make a dreary fuss?

How many of us have the courage to look at life as well spent?
For what other price could we pay for dreams that went
Just as per the Divine's planning - not to forget, it's ours too
For life is co-scripted, though this secret known to just a few.

Monies hoarded can be spent in an instant's folly.
It is Time that's hardest to put to good use, and wholly
Are we to blame for not filling the unforgiving minute
With 60 seconds worth of distance run, and yet

We complain of so many things done or not done.
Still though, we must find the will and courage to find one
Moment in time that we can claim as our very own.
Anyone who tells you that you are unworthy, please do disown.

My advice to you, all friends - is to just recover fast and keep moving
We know this life as bumpy, yet chose it, so make it one of giving
I know times are tough and that people may seem rather callous
But give them time to learn of love, perhaps even learn from us.
