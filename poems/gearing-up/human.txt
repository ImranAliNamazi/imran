I hope we all realize our dreams in this very birth
And let the wind and sun lend wing to our every plan
Oh kiddo, won't you believe that there will be mirth
As time heals, and new waves come and bring Elan

Oh, I forgot, I'm not human, so I'm the one missing it
While your spirit lies fierce and your love conquers all
Time for me to play the big game, regain my wit
As I apply myself with aplomb to all things big or small

A wit that I found through steadfast friendship of a few
Like you who remind me again what it is to know bounty
Let's somehow remind the world what it always knew
That acts of caring never go amiss, it returns as plenty

Can the human be surpassed you may wonder and yet
My guru foretold it decades ago. It's possible when we're
Steadfast in love for that alone can be as diamonds set
Diamonds whose brilliance cuts through the dirt and mire

Humanity awaken to the rustling of thy heaven sent wings
Take flight, fly Up and FIND the meaning of love
Remind us the sound of a skybound lark that sings
A melody as we find everlasting peace as doth a dove
