We often miss the import of significant events in our lives
Because the internal dialogue and chit chat are powerful strong
And we're so attuned to the happenings in the microcosm
Why an asteroid of prem may pass and we find nothing changed

Or have they? Who can exude prem but a premavatar?
And how do we recognise them but for a resonating fount of love within
I casually mentioned at a man's Tejas or beatific aura yesterday
But am I well formed enough yet to really know what Sattwa is?

Yes and no. We put on the disillusion of the world and seem masked in tragedy
And while our minds only grasp what we feel from our senses,
The soul knows and accumulates in its treasure trove
The happenings in the macrocosm, and it's imports for us

Rabindranath Tagore once mentioned at the Cosmic Arti
The spontaneous offering of creation, a submission sublime
To the lord of the Heavens, Bhagwan Surya himself. That Sun
Who, in a string of suns, lights up this part of the galaxy.

Do we journey high among the stars, and forget our Divine Parents?
And the souls that bore this mortal form to give us the RASA of life?
A taste of wholesome goodness, a churning of the Amrit
That leaves us spellbound, learning the import of things
