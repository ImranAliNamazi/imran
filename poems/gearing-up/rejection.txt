Goodness gracious how we have been rejected this night
All my friend did was offer you love, try to be a knight
We beg and plead that you give us a whiff of your delight
Now I wonder if you will join us, ah that'd be a sight

I believe that friendship is the ultimate source of joy
And what pleasure would it be to have this other boy
As you go down the path wondering at the moments
When this fellow will allow himself to speak his sentiments

Scene podathe mami, Nangal unna pudchirku
Come stay with us, help us to to find in life a clue
What can I say to convince you that we're good company
Stay a while with us and help us this dawn to see

Entropy teaches us to be free and joyous as an atom
As we look to green pastures, wonder to speak an om.
Now the boys in all their meanness are trying to rap
I've been the victim of it, boy they can really say crap

Imran waits to be taught to become human and pass
Bharath wishes to make you comfortable which he may, at last
Johnya is your new name now, so dream on my dear
Go build a new trove of memories, with him always be near
