I think often of Aule who laboured long and gave freely
But am guilty of taking on too much, shrugging noisily
As I dash this or other person's hope and then brood
As Niggle may have those aeons ago, in somber mood.

Then I think of Feanor inciting and wonder at His power
That sets ideas into motion when it's time to gather,
People to this or other cause, and rally them forth.
To give as Jonathan did, gaily and his soul's worth.

Then the Lion-heart comes to mind and moves me so
With his words that resonate so much, then deeply echo
As they laugh on in the river as the Messiah passes by.
Oh Donald, you taught so much, foremost to ask why.

<strong>I wonder at you my dear, what kiln forged you so tough,
Yet sensitive of heart and steadfast, also kind not gruff.
How can I explain what it means to have a loving friend,
After so many years of being bereft, now on the mend.</strong>

What other characters do we have that toughen us up?
Remind us what joy can be ours, what dreams aloft?
I wait for the never ending story to lead a way out of hell,
As I promised the Empress I'd create something special
