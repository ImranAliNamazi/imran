I wish you one day soon, that joy will overflow.
For now, know that I am there to hug if you're low.
I understand dear, that life's been rough on you,
Know that love awaits to embrace precious you.

Gasp for breath as you feel a newfound delight
As your friends remind you of your innate might.
I don't say much, but I can squeeze your hand,
Take you on a long walk in the sun, on the sand.

Knowing me as steadfast and stubborn, do smile
As you find a poise, serene and worth every while
Take a moment to gather yourself, then think aloud
Of friends you care for as you chase away their cloud.

Thank you kanna, for being a patch of sunshine to me.
So much I wish for you, that rich fields you'll see.
As you coast along the pathways of life, a force pristine,
Why almost perfect, your senses their utmost keen.

I know that each moment you feel to the full, so
Think of the secret of life, as new fields you sow,
And water with your blood, sweat and tears
For then will life be kind, as we wait on the years.
