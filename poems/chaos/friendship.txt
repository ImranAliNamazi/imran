Friendship, Imran, 26th Apr 2019. For Veena

Are you a friend or foe to Mother Nature?
Do you smile or has life been rather unfair?
Have you lost a friend who was quite mature?
Was her friendship enough to melt a care?

Have you a partner you've known for many years?
Does he bring balance, give you a life of purpose?
Dont mind the worries, dont remember the tears
All God asks is that we bring balance to the Force

Do you still speak to the girl from your childhood?
Did her friendship mean all the world to you?
Now how often do you call to uplift her mood?
Say forever, and never let her again be blue

Was your brother a source of joy? Did you get caught
For stealing mangoes together? Where is he today?
Has he taken a ride in the BMW you just bought?
Just pick up the phone, invite him to come and stay

Girls and Boys, Ladies and Gents to you I do implore
To use time well for it is short, forget the lows
For a moment gone is a moment lost so be sure
To have no regrets when the whistle blows
