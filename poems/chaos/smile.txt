Smile, Jul 15th, for Shobi

It's time to get the mix right, then explode like dynamite!

Dearest Shobi,

3 short years we've known each other
I wish you well in any kind of weather
You've stood by me in thick and thin
Buttered my bread, made me grin

Thanks for visiting with mom last week
I saw my mom smile amidst her bleak
I think she's better now but am not too sure
Why I have to hurt her when to me she's dear

I'll see you Tuesday before I leave to see
My 2 clients who are waiting to receive me
And then perhaps my love for now she's back
From that dreaded boss who deserves a smack

Smile when you see this, as once again I rhyme
For I'm now adept at a written art so sublime
Can we sit down and make a poem together
Its easy to do so, and can make u feel better

Write of dungeons and dragons like Smaug
And evenings in woods, lost in a heavy fog
Remember that poems touch deep to the core
Leave you begging, simply begging for more!

----

5th may...

Thank you Shobi for being there
Making me know that you care
Listening to me as I dreamt on
Supporting me until my dawn

We sensed a goodness in each other
And built a friendship on top of that
Now let's always have cause to remember
That goodness is meant to be shared
