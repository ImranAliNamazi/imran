Inspire, 14th July

Since he last wrote for her it had been a while
A hearty laugh from her made his inners smile
When they made love, they became as one
On a pillow of cirrus, their challenges won

I'll be there for you, these 5 words I swear to you
Let's take a boat out on the waves, a splendid view
A place to see the nights pass into day, when sunshine
Makes me feel that I want you, so forever be mine

We've always been one, out hearts entwined
So love me to eternity baby, unravel my mind
Tell me we'll make heaven on Earth right here
Fill all our heart's desires, you are my cure

Make me give my best, for with you at my chest
I want to make the entire world find it's very crest
Where angels come in all shapes and hues
Forever me dear, let's together find all clues

To make a change in those lives we touch
Be mine as I find how to give so much
Love back to you as only you can inspire
come to me baby, flood a current in my wire
