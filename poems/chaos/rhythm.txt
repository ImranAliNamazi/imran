Rhythm, Imran, 26th Apr 2019. For F

The beating of my heart is a drum and its lost
It beats in solitude, withering without your touch
Its looking for the rhythm of you, a ghost
That once flooded my hand with so much

Spirit. Now I think back to the time when we were
Constantly in each other's hearts and minds
Looking forward to the moment in which to utter
Words of love for all seasons and all climes

We were in love, so totally and completely alive
It felt like perfection, having you at my side
Now apart I doubt that ever again I'll thrive
As prolific as I once was, now only woe betide

If you could but return a fraction of my love
I'd be pleased as punch, fight the good fight
Have me once more let me soar like a dove
Into timeless tomorrow's, bring all my might

To bear on this life which I'd fill with songs of you
As I search the heavens for a cause of your delight
Sorely do I rue this day when I must bid adieu
Former queen of my heart, source of yester light
