Visions of you, Neelu, 31 May

Hi baby boy, your soon to be three
Sing out with joy, sing with much glee
We love you more each passing day
So kiss us as you set out to play

Kiss mama when you wake up at dawn
To watch a butterfly alight on the lawn
Take your gardening set down to the park
Watch as good morning says a lark

Remember we love you just for being you
So cuddly and cute, even when your blue
So let anger and sadness all wash away
As bold and upright you find your own way

Smile when we all gather around you
To play with your toys tell stories to you
Make sure to jump in puddles and drive us wild
As we struggle to find our own inner child

I remember every day when I held you to me
When you made my spirit soar, so very naturally
Bless us with more days when angels like you
Remind us of ourselves, and we're never blue
