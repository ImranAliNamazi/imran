Planetary Healing, Imran, 26th Apr 2019. For Simon

Our collective experience is in our DNA embedded
Especially the past 3 generations and 10 lifetimes
These find their way into the stories that abound
Paving the way for us to have much better times

As we shake off the wrongdoings of the past
Life a life of forgiveness, true to the task
Of building a better world, built to last
As we treasure the joys in our soul's cask

They say the key to happiness is in forgiving
Perhaps we seek that gift is why so much hate
Let's forge a future, one truly worth living
We've squandered time, stop before it's too late

Let's shake off the remnants of ages gone past
I say again to stress we've little time left to us
Build a structure on love that forever will last
As we serve each other, make no more fuss

For who can speak for tomorrow as time flies by
Mere mortals we are with infinity in our reach
Use time well, ask of your creator not why
Rather give in the moment, your best in each
