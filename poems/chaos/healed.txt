Healed, Imran, 26th Apr 2019. For F

Strongly and daily you attracted me to you
Till I felt completely in love, no longer blue
Joyous was I to have your plentiful love
As to its depths, with life I gleefully strove

Little did I wonder what I would do without you
It's now been a lifetime of pain, a year or two
More and I'll be permanently inert, my heart bereft
And devoid of love, wondering if one truly adept

At mending a broken heart should ever come
Into my life, strive to make me one and become
A beacon to my senses. Do I wait for her and see
If my heart can find again amidst life some glee

Was my love not good enough, worth keeping
What matters the truth, my heart needs healing
So wait I do for time it is said heals all wounds
Look forward to love again, I know no bounds

As I think of the last 180 days and the hope it brings
That healed I am as my heart finds new springs
What we had we both know was timeless
In all that I went through I hold you blameless
