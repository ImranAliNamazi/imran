Healing - 14th April, Joint

Everyone deserves unconditional love especially from themselves
The inner child in me is alive when I'm surrounded with the loved
Any kind of beginning starts ultimately with ourselves
I hope that I can make magic with my dearly beloved

Deep down we are always happy at the core
Because that's how God made us - it multiplies manifold
Open the door, invite in abundance, multiply it more
With each day let new friends willingly enter the fold

It's a beautiful experience, joy is blissful, spread forth
Happiness can be contagious, so make room for it
Care and faith are important, never forget them both
Forget the past, dream of a future, make it brilliantly lit

Empathy is something we all need to carry unto infinity
Peace and understanding are the ultimate divine grace
Beauty lies within, spread it with joy like confetti
Take it all in your loving, all transcending embrace

Belief in oneness for in the world there is much beauty
Colourful is and amply textured is life, live it by faith
Take it from above, practice compassion as fervent duty
Like a child laughing with glee, run around or run straight
