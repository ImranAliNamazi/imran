Yesterday I remembered you [memory], 15 Jul

Friend, we've shared many pleasant memories together
The thought of seeing you again makes my heart flutter
I think of all the times you put a smile on my face
And wonder how your doing amidst the rat race

A race I quit in February and do not want to run again
Will I yieldmore like in my dreams or will it all be in vain
A question that leaves me more angry than persevering
For in the midst of all, I feel abandoned by the family inner ring

Am back on my medication now and slowing down a mite
It's time to get the mix right, then explode like dynamite
Into laser sharp action as only engineers can fathom
At speeds of tackions that would make a mortal seem dumb

Leave that boring ingenuity as something that will happen
And tell me about your life for glad tidings my heart would hearken 
Have you been good? Pray tell me honestly about yourself
Was it only yesterday we met outside a dwarrowdelf?

Remember to keep free in October of twenty twenty
When I'll get married to one whom I want should meet thee
As we take your blessings for you're a hero in this world
Sweet and daring, tough as kevlar, carefree and bold!
