Beacon - April 9th

Far across the distance and spaces that separate us two
You my love are like a beacon in the dark, needed like glue
To bind the sheaves of my heart and its rhythm
The sunlight in my universe, me thoughts but a hymn

That sing thy praise for foremost are you in my mind
Wont you come in my dear lady, be one of a kind
That makes my heart flutter ever so soft as at dawn
When a million buttercups open and birds begin their song

On a mountain the dew tastes sweet and cool
On a starlit night we wrap ourselves in wool
Theres so many ways I wish to kiss you softly
Under the heavens I look for a trace of you in me
