You, Imran, 26th Apr 2019. For L

I touch the top of your head with wonder
My heart races, I touch your lips so tender
I massage your toes and press your feet
I kiss your nose and cheeks ever so sweet

I pull your ears and caress your forehead
I whisper gently as I slowly take you to bed
I grasp your legs and spend awhile at rest
You embrace me, clutching my manly chest

Our fingers explore again our legs and hands
It's fun to hear the water as we walk on sands
I long for your embrace, it's been half a year
Come touch me softly, let me taste your ear

I hold your hips as we sway to good old tunes
It's hard that we've been parted so many moons
Sing for me as bright as dawn that comes our way
What can I do except whip up the courage to say

I want more, I'm waiting for you to have and to hold
We promised each other we'd let our dreams unfold
I grip your waist hold the nape of your neck and say
I love you sweetheart, kiss me and let me lead the way
