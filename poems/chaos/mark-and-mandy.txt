Mark and Mandy ride again - 7th May

Mark had had a poster of Dusty Fogg since he was five
Above Mandy's bed was a painting of an Elven tree
Their holidays were here, they wanted to learn to dive
In the nearby lake, they were young and wild and free

They lived in a little town on the Italian coast
Papa built furniture, mama ran a diner
Their evenings were spent in joyland in play
And nights mama and papa took turns reading to them

From leaves collected from the tree of life
Beneath the sky, beneath the moon
Whilst their friends were filled with different stories
Of lands fashioned by writers hands

For in no other medium was the essence of humanity caught
Than in stories told for mirthful glee
And delight in the moment of their utterance
Many dawns had found them far from home

Along the edges of the lake, in quiet glades
Bold they were and inseparably bound
He with his sketchbook she with her brushes
Together new stories they would weave
