Enough, Imran, 12th Apr 2019

Maybe it's time I started using the word sub-human
Its heart wrenching to read the news every darned day
The perpetrators that coup everything are at it again
It seems nowhere is a light to caringly guide the way

Unite and rest not until the day is won I screamed
But that movement was halted for various reasons
What is this planet becoming, what have we dreamed
What will we do to change these blackened seasons

For every selfish politician there is a dedicated leader
So Simon, come back and smoke out these politicians
Make everyone remember we can make the world better
Let leaders unite, the planet needs more beauticians

People with beauty and love in their hearts to serve
Not selfish spoiled little rascals building corrupt empires
What a disgrace to the title of human. Let's not swerve
From the path of what's right. Let these bloody vampires

Be outcast and thrust into the void outside. Make heroes
Instead, a large database of all those dedicated leaders
Watch the magic as they unite and expunge these zeroes
Misfits we call sub humans, unite fast my dear readers
