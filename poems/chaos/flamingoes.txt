Flamingoes 23 April

Four musicians played a tune all at once
Amidst them all I stood there a dunce
Tuneless I sat amidst the chaos of it all
Making no noise, feeling very very small

One arose and glanced at me and laughed
Said dummy cant you stop being so daft
It's you I want to spend eternity with so there
Can love well in you like a breath of fresh air

Then another got up and said to hold her again
For the last time I did she had said I was to blame
For not making her want to spend eternity together
Now I wonder will our love stay true in any weather

The 3rd got up and said brother why dont you wake up
It's me you should have said forever to and ended up
Spending eternity in my presence as once you tried
By gracing my presence with your smile all wired

Four was one I madly wrote to one night in July
The years have passed swiftly and in your arms I lie
As the heavens burst showering us with flakes of snow
I'll never know which to choose, where love can grow
