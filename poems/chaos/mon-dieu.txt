Mon Dieu, Imran, 12th Apr 2019

If God had a name what would it be?
And would you call it to his face?
Look into your heart, open eye and see
That God lives in every last Earthly place

He lives too, on the dark side of the moon
And beyond the starbursts of Orion and Lyra
In the honeycomb, the whistle of a heavenly tune
Across the seas and in expanses of sky, a

Stark reminder that woe to the fallen
Who worship the Devil in his dark tower
And forget to trim the lamps of pollen
Who forsake grace in their needy hour

Was He an alien of the race of the Devas
Was He a symbol of dynamism and timelessness
As Kala and Bhairava does He make ours
A place of surpassing beauty, enter our nests

And reveal Himself at the Kernel of Bliss
Where His Sovereignty is all to the true Bhakta
Who waits only to find the source and not miss
The chance of a lifetime to ride the Divine Ladder

And find at its top the Kingdom of Heaven
Where only the good remains uncorrupted
And falsehood and folly are broken and cloven
Sincerely we seek and become indebted

To Mother Nature who tends to our cares with love
And guides us to be bold and count on our luck
That soon with relentlessness as gift from above
We will win all our dreams, and never be stuck

What more joy that to meet our maker and find
Our purpose in this madness as eagerly we wait
Until the day we tread with panache, utterly kind
For our Lord knows the way and waits at the gate

For us to distil his essence and win the day
And glowing we seem to be freed at last
For finally in our hearts he's come to stay
And break the Evils that haunted our past

What good amid these o me o life
The answer, that you must face trials aplenty
And win immortality heedless of strife
That cause you to smile, finding Gods bounty
