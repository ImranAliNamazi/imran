3 years ago, Niha - 31 May

I met you when you used to laugh with glee
Sweet was your smile as you called out to me
I remember reading books on Sunday
Now I wonder what you read every day

Your adorable when you smile so smile always
Show us your spirit in oh so many ways
Remember the beauty of stories grows richer
As they leave an indelible mark on our culture

I was there the night you first rode on a horse
Excited you were, laughing until you were hoarse
The beach was pretty with blue lights that night
On the horsie, mama held on to you so tight

Sing bhajans in prayer with Paati every morning
As a strand of the divine to this earth you bring
I hope you enjoy school like I did, smile always
As you make a better world in oh so many ways

In two years you've nearly forgotten me dear
But I come at times to spread good cheer
For its children like you that make my life tenable
As I set off to make all our dreams achievable
