Shoka Vinasha Karanam - destroying your sadness
Filling you with light, heavenly glowing starlight
What can I do to cure this unending madness
Robs me of my smile, keeps me in darkest night

You were the dawn, the promise of morning light
I wait to hold you in my embrace, fill your universe
Make you feel whole again as I hold you so tight
As day to day in me you inspire a new writ verse

A smile you bring to me as you pat my shoulder
Uplift my mood and wash away all my cares
A pillar of support, strong as a veritable boulder
A shoulder to cry on, as I take on the world's dares

Was it just yesterday we spoke so ardently of love
When walking on the sands of time I held your hand
Touched you deep inside and a spell around you wove
Let's make love again, have our own musical band

Singer you, songwriter I, we need only a piano man
Have we only just begun with a spontaneous smile
To change the taste of life for every last human
That inhabits this world, carefree for a little while
