Kiss and Make Up - May 12

Today was my father's birthday, we fear with dread it may be his last. My best friend has spent numerous dinners with the 5 of us - me, dad, cousin and 2 uncles. Today we were all there though theres so much water underneath the bridge we dont go out anymore. We put our differences aside for the love of a gentle soul - Shayesteh Namazi.

I dont know why now, but I've spent a whole life building walls between me and him, even watching Field of Dreams didnt break it all away. Ideological differences be damned, this is someone who can be proud to say he raised me well, with the best intentions and ALWAYS GAVE HIS BEST.

I'm happy we've spoken a bit in the last 10 years, that I've not been a complete ass, but I feel sadder still for those countless millions for whom the gulf separating them from either parent is too wide to bridge in this lifetime.

I go now to meet this child, in his 65th year whose toothless smile will haunt me the rest of my days as I wonder will I ever live up to his epithet, superman.

I leave you with my best friend's imperative:

"My life's only achievement was that my Dad died on my lap and  I asked for forgiveness for everything  said and unsaid, the relief I felt was immense while I felt sorrow for his loss, I had no regrets. TOMORROW MAY BE TOO LATE !!!!!"
