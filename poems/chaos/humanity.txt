Humanity 2 May

Where's our humanity when we are mostly sub human?
Does it not break it's bonds, strive to make us men
And women of character? Let's fight and be in the van
Of the war to regain our glory of old. Ask not when

But immediately - I implore you to not be discouraged
Immediately start growing towards the sun and stand
Like a banyan tree in this subtle war that daily is waged
As we rediscover the divinity, form a warrior band

Warriors who win for humanity the beauty of tomorrow
A beauty that's promised in all the scriptures of old
That kingdom of heaven - break the bonds, feel not low!
Win the fight, never compromise and let your soul be sold

Rather discover it's new crests everyday as your dreams
You lend wings to to grow - truly, madly, deeply grow
The devil is everywhere the future looms bleak it seems
Its always darkest before light so let your light glow

That inner light which existed before aught else was made
So fight the good fight, dont worry, just win the day
Be divinely dynamic not inert, let your spirit not fade
Life is good, live it well, that what grandpa used to say
