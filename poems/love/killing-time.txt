It's only me whose killing time [Cliff Richard]
Wanting to go back to that construct
That filled my senses for a while [John Denver]
Where silence was so potent

But in between those silences was
A stream of whispered intimacies
Now its all just a memory oh baby
Where did all that tender love go?

Tell Tracey I love her. Tell her I need her! [Everly Brothers]
Tell her the wait is over
I've become who I wanted
If only she'll abide in my arms again

Then my life replete will be
Another spring when love overflows
Can this poor heart bear another winter
Oh shall I find a hundred ribbons [Tony Orlando]

Or find im just gone to pieces [Freddie Mercury]
"Hold me in your arms for just another day
I promise this one will go slow" [Air Supply]
Ah memory, guess you'll have to do
