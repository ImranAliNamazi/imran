Were so close to being there for one another
Then fate closes a door and then its a bother
The love we had just died because the angel in me
Was cheated by the devil who got his hold on you

Where are you my brother
Where are you my lover
Where are you my sister
Where are you my father

Why do we lose so consistently
When there's angels among us
Seems everything weve ever known is here
I never wanted it to die

Time has taken its toll on you
Open your eyes and drink again
from the stream that is life
Angels persevere to the bitter end
The klaxon has not yet sounded

So wake from this stupor that devours
Open up your eyes and turn the page
Dwell in the houses of tomorrow
Whilst there's still springs to drink from
