Many new blessed things didst appear
From the heavens above, a grace like a cure
For all the maladies that shook us, tearing up apart
And then a restorative, love pouring from the heart

Of the many millions we share this Earth with
Flowing towards those bereft, grief-struck, now enriched
We have a twin source - a potent all sanctioning Lord
And his Queen - creatrix of all the universe. Accord

And fraternity and sorority and egalite and harmony
As only sweet music men can conjure - a symphony
In which our darkest fears are dispelled by jyoti - light
No more can avidya come and rob the splendour of our night

A night that precludes the coming dawn - That symbol dawn!
The hour before the God's awoke! No more time left to yawn
For us the forerunners that spread joy to our parent's delight
Will Tulkas enjoin the battle, valiant and mirthful with his might?

What other cast aside heroes will we resurrect in this final march
Back to Eden, that Eden we shalt henceforth build on Earth
A million splendid suns as Lord Krishna didst promise
Will we find it now and make this future slip into bliss
