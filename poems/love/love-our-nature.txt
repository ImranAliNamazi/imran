I saw the world as one one night
No more wars, no waking in fright
Long and hard we had dreamed
Wake up and unite, we screamed

We came from places in so many hues
Following our instinct, reading clues
Time to watch as new horizons appear
Give all ur heart, dream on my dear

Our numbers swelled, our ranks grew
Embrace change we did as time flew
Make the most of it we did each day anew
As people each brought in a fresh world-view

<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LoveOurNature?src=hash" target="_blank">#LoveOurNature</a> we said as we looked inside
Saw everyone unite, instil a sense of pride
Together we'd spend the rest of our days
Be as one, as always, live a life of grace

Stand on the Shoulders of Giants with vision we do
As in the deeps of time come wonders in every hue

"He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst, he's not the best"
