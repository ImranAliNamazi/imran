To have and to hold in sickness and in health
In gladness and in gloominess in sorrow and in mirth
My soul is perhaps overflowing with the wine of the ages
Long years have passed since my faith was strengthened by the sages

A strength I asked for to stand boldly and serve
Live life to the full welcome you all in a drove
Friends and loved ones, all sorts that me do bless
Above them all, you who taught me love and kindness

Brother your silence does render me bereft
Of most of my senses, your loss like a theft
Of all that once was good in me a joy to behold
Now inept my very blood's run a little cold

Will there be time for us in this life to regain
your love or is it that which stifles like ball and chain
How long does it take to know that I'm still here
A bit frazzled but determined to make you smile once more

Why does ego finally seem to have the upper hand
Between us two who've been closer than dust and sand
Is there no more joy in your life, a joy in giving
Your best to me and I, all my loving
