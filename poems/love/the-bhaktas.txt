Love for the divine is itself a grace
All of us are blessed to have its peace
It springs from a deep well in our heart
With us right from a very early start

So what is this divine some may ask
And seemingly daunting that task
Of finding a presence transcending it all
But find it we can and bask and have a ball

For God lives in us all, even the faint of heart
Find the Divine we shall like an unerring dart
That reaches its center against cross-blowing winds
Ah this life full of our myriad wonderful minds

Ways in which to meet our sublime creator
Who guides with love the human theatre
An accepting love thats caring and nurturing
Filling our cup to overflow and with daring

To see the least of His plans come full wrought
Us children of his innermost thought
A day we have in which to finish the task
Find our humanity - preserve it in our cask
