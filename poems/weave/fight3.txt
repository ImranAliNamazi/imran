Guess we're in the thick of it now, embroiled and bitter.
I know life can drive us all mad, but please don't hit her!
For she loves us with a considerable force of conviction
So unchain your brain, and let her love for us pour in.

He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst, he's not the best (Pink Floyd)

So fight on my dear friends, fight as your life depends on it.
Transform yourselves, remembering to show true grit
As it takes a lifetime of perseverance to attain - it and equipoise.
We need a laughter to outweigh the din, a silence to drown out the noise.

Are we at peace now or is the crowd of thoughts still conflicting?
Do we wanna continue with the screams or break loose and sing?
I've nearly had the stuffing inside me knocked out as I think
Of the limited time left with loved ones - less than a blink.

As they say, life goes and and tarries not with yesterday.
So chin up, look to the Heavens and boldly say.
That your days of fighting have only just begun,
Then begin to shine, the resplendence of the sun.

There is peace now, a newfound peace settling deep within,
Why I look different in the mirror with a kiss and a grin,
Thinking of ways to become my best self, erupt in toil.
Come friends let's bask in the sun, swim in the soil.
