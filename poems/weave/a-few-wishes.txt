I wish you dear, every happiness in the world.
To see your dreams bathed in magic waters, ever a whorl.
Follow them relentlessly and soon you will find.
That you have built your own heaven, a way out of the human bind.

I wish you dear, to spread the message of two feet to fly.
For those that persevere, soon figure a way out of the lie -
The lie that tells us we need to put our noses in the dirt,
Why not encourage people to conquer their hurdles - do good on Earth.

I wish you dear to use your own feet and fly up
Fly up and find the meaning of love, overflow your cup,
Then look to those around you and help them bear
The lows that life drives them to, show them you care.

I wish you dear to find the innermost secret to life,
As hinted to in our Gita, it's poise amidst all strife.
A poise that enables us to guide along and see,
That there is no more separate you or me.

I wish you dear to build a legacy that will last,
Through the ages - helping humanity to leave the past
Where in silliness we were petty and disappointed the other,
Come now my friend, show us all the care you can gather.
