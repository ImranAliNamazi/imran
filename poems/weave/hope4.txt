It's an individual struggle to manifest our Inherent Divinity,
For, as is said, to realise ourselves is the best service we can render humanity!
What we win goes into our collective - so tastelessly swayed by propaganda...
But overcome it we shall - our aim being complete victory in the battlefield, ya?

Guess we're lucky to have stayed true to our vision,
As we ride up and down the river of dreams,
With it's ebbs and flows, ebbs people blame us for with much derision,
But humanity, let's wake from our nightmare and let go the screams.

No matter how valiant we are as warriors, just as the figurines fall of the temple wall,
Soon we will be pushing up daisies, so I guess the watchword of the now
Is to never tire to help in the labours of Mother Earth - works both big and small,
As she builds a new world and we can collaborate, but we scream a despondent how.

Have faith in the process my dears, how it works is that we reflect the macrocosm - Earth and the Universe,
Which means it's the dissonance in the music which makes us want to change the world - make it peaceful.
To fight Ravana, we have to be strong as Rama, guided by some inner verse,
A verse that is soon quelled by the cacophony as we, th microcosm, are more in tune by being mindful.

Equipoise means, we do not let circumstance weigh on us, nor feel on top of the world, you see
We've long since surrendered the outcome yet insist on giving our best.
Dream of changing the world and soon we'll have broken the bonds and can dance with glee,
For the road has led us to victory in a titanic battle that raged around where our wits were put to the test!
