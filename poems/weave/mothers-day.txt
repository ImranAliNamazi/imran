There is a beautiful mother I know - celebrates each day,
Listens to her daughter lost in dreams, doesn't know what to say.
Don't worry dear, I tell her, that's just how we were raised,
By our own mothers who taught us never by life to be fazed.

And when we children grow up, choose we must do,
To leave away our dream world that's only meant for a few.
Rather climb the corporate ladder until in a single day the “cloud” does burst,
Then we can go back to our beginnings, find what life is worth.

Dear old friend I've seen much strength in thee,
Knows to get the most of life, not complain sorrowfuly.
I worry now and then for mothers like you, who truly try with all you might,
To give us children a strong and healthy footing so we'll never back down from the fight.

What fight one may ask - why there's a million things to choose from.
Or perhaps like is said to ‘Juna, it's not a game to lose or be won,
Only to be played, learning to have glide in our stride,
For then humanity will have turned the course of the tide.

Which mother am I talking to now? Sometimes my head is in a swirl,
I should thank my own mother perhaps for her steadfast love that keeps me awhorl.
Go now mommas and pappas, make of life a miracle.
By living fully alive and walking the sunlit path until your cask is afill.
