My friend wants me to elaborate on his good and bad qualities,
While life is much more forgiving when he learns to give from his heart.
We try to please others for what reason I don't know, we show them niceties,
When all we need is to realign ourselves with the cosmos and go back to the start.

To when we were in college and formed deep bonds with friends,
They helped us discover ourselves, our convictions put to the test.
Now 40, we've forgotten what were about - but life never ends.
We just go from one experience to the next, often trying to wrest

The utmost from this little beauty called life, we are sure
That certain things and people we would like to avoid.
Instead spread beauty in God's little Eden, find a cure
For the maladies of life, but sometimes of energy we feel devoid.

Don't worry about good and bad qualities my dear friend,
We're just actors playing different roles in each other's lives.
That's just the soul contract - not meant to drive one around the bend,
Go with the flow instead, following your heart and see how humanity thrives

Dear Dilip, I'm happy to see the family man you have become.
I knew you as a deep thinker long pondering the future of humanity,
So weave that thought into the tapestry of your children as you ask them to come
Closer to the Divine Source, help rid the world of it's insanity.
