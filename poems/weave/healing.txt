If bad #leaders come from a bad #society and are elected by us,
And our bs #radars are never up to not be swayed by #propaganda,
What's the point, #humanity, in crying at this or other outrage, even #genocide?
I still maintain it's the last #fight of the evil #forces and they are soon to be #driven out!

Driven out of our collective #psyche, but who is to heal the #tainted #soul of the #abhorrent?
The Day the Earth stood still tells of an Alien civilization wanting to #expunge us,
Is that day today I wonder? And who will fight for Earth?
Will the call of peace be heard? Goldberg's or Merek's cry?

The #eucatastrophe nears with each day, but who will sue for pardon?
And beg our intercessors to pray for #Divine #Grace?
Weve forgotten the words of love that #Krishna, #Buddha, #Christ and #Mohammed bore us!
Can the tide of human #destruction be reversed?

Reversed by a #collective voice of #peaceful #warriors who CRY -
We withdraw our #CONSENT from #EVIL, no longer letting #rape and mass #murder be the norm.
Not letting any "faith" #divide us, perhaps it's time for #pluralism to reign.
So go #within, those of you who realise, that it's only #love can #conquer.

Save a #damned soul from endless hell-fire, like #RaisBhuiyan did some decades ago.
Follow the true #nature of #yourself, not this #mindless and wanton #perpetration of #hate.
Is our time up? I wonder? Or can we #stem the tide?
What means to live a #LifeDivine? Desist from allowing evil to #perpetrate else woe betide!
