Each of us, a part of the Cosmic Divine has a Deva Bhava -
A Divine Nature, that we can apply to all aspects of ourselves.
A total integration of personal, professional, social and spiritual.
Which comes first you may ask, but the sages say them all.

How can there be a professional without a "person" behind it?
These key aspects are what gives balance to our lives.
From whence comes a natural outpouring from our inner being,
The fruitage of the soul, as we live a life of taking and giving.

Often times it's a taking of some common problem that many face,
And whether we face it with vairagyam (dispassion) or with much emotion,
We're led with that spiritual fervour to solve it and send that wisdom back into the Morphic Field,
From where all of humanity can access it when faced with a similar challenge.

I know I've said a lot my friend, here's wishing you strength
To walk with much zeal and zest, as these 4 aspects find you well along their path.
A new phase of your career has begun, and a spectacular trajectory awaits,
Just have faith in the process, an indomitable faith that permeates.
You would remember better than I, the manifold qualities one should possess.

To walk, not just on the spiritual path, but on the personal and professional as well.
I wish for there to be a lot of "magic" in your life - like when a Goddess gifts you a spell.
Star of wonder, star of light! May your dreams come true.
Then you'll be a force to reckon with, in every aspect of the dream life you make.
