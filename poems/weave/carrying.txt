A dua we make that our baby girl is a delight to all,
A pacifist she will be, spreading peace and standing tall.
An aquanaut too, diving deep and searching for our source.
Magnesium she takes not letting life take it's course,

Rather, fighting for human rights not letting another Gaza happen.
As a contemporary artist, her work is a spontaneous expression.
Diapers we change but soon she'll learn to take care of herself,
Driving us bananas, with a mischievous smile that makes her look like an elf.

Dallas, her birthplace where she will have memories to treasure,
Texans take her into the wilderness, showing her love without measure.
Identifying as a global citizen, she strives to solve the riddle of this world,
Spirited and sweet she goes on from mission to mission ever in a whirl.

Her uncle makes her think of the Jagat Kula or world family,
With unlimited courage, she helps a stream of people steadily.
Visits to the Amazon helps her go deep within and find inspiration,
She wonders at the hormonal changes her mother went through while her husband was in another nation.

We sang Que Sera Sera but wished her strong enough to carve her own destiny.
A beacon of light to those who would sail the high seas.
Her aura is bright and vivant as she springs from task to task,
Kimchi she consumes as she drinks ambrosia from a flask.
