It may have seemed that a lot of things u said fell on deaf ears,
But your gentleness has left an impression on me - gentle over the years
I have been asked by another friend to go deeper within.
Perhaps I will, perhaps I won't, leaving you all in chagrin :p

Seriously, I remember the cripple from Illusions,
And how Shimoda just urged him to walk - such is the power of visions.
I'm walking now and I owe a lot of it to you my dear.
Time to go uplift others with a jubilant song, have then of life no longer fear!
