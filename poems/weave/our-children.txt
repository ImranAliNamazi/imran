When our children were younger and it was summer,
Their kites unfurled beneath a deep blue sky.
Now a tad older, they strive to take upon their shoulder,
The responsibility for taking us all to a new high.

<!--more-->

But the clouds above burst and it's thunder in our ears,
As we run helter-skelter and pray the rain gods to stop!
Our cry is heard, a blue sky prevails for many years,
But the land is parched because, of rain water, there is no drop.

We need to be equal to sunny skies and storm-bringers,
As we chase for the elusive riddle of this world.
Perhaps in loving kindness we should BE - like the Seers
Gone past. To exuberate energy like so many bolts hurled.

Bolts of energy and love, reaching one and all,
Oh humanity, could we start again please? This time be
A font of goodness, like those of Elder Days - stand tall!
Never bowing down to the dark forces who would, in glee,

Cause us to forget our Divine origins and true stature,
Forget what it is to have the sun and the wind on our face,
Instead drag us into the dirt and wrestle us in a quagmire.
Let's hand our children stewardship of this planet with grace.
