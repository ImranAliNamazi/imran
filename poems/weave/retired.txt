The mentally retarded was tired doing nothing,
So she decided to retire
and never could get herself to do something.
A phase now past, do you believe she can inspire?

That's about everything...
Here is her story,
Now isn't that something?
Aren't we all trying to win glory?

She came out of retirement just to find herself,
'Cause in the interstices between living there is no peace.
For whats left unachieved and undone, we answer to the self...
Don't let go, says she - for then on life you will have a new lease!

Let go of what? This dullard of a boy asked.
Why your dreams silly! We need to educate
Everyone to fight fey and make themselves tasked
To the joy of finding their calling, others to liberate.

This world's going to hell in a handbasket you know?
But the fight is not yet over, so call everyone you care for.
We can catalyze change if we work together to grow,
For then we can stop these fools doing thins we abhor!
