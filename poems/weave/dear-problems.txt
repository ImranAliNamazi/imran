I have been lovingly guided to inform you just how big GOD is.

You used to keep tripping me up, but it is said to be mindful of every moment.

You have us in a stupor with external and internal senses dullened and we forget.

But when we are alive to each moment, we feel intimately the source of our creation.

Oh GOD, what a fool I was to think you had abandoned me - when in fact you were lifting me over the jumble and mess that was my mind.

Now my mind is clearer, so it's time to set you free and bask again in both sunlight and twilight - GOD's gift to us.
