Shining through, smiling back at all who wait to cross.
There is no loss?

In the absolute sense, there is no loss,
But how many of us realize this in the madness after a love has gone, our lives gone for a toss?

Madness, sheer madness at the memory of how things used to be... You see,
We feel the glimmer of a caress here - wasn't that how things were always supposed to be?

Robbed of love when it was just waxing to it's full.
Now bereft, what can we do amidst the lull?

Wake up our loved ones scream for they see us slipping away.
Let the winter of your grief pass that in springtime ye may dance once more and sway.

What of the ones that remain we may very well be asked?
Waves of emotion come and go, but to love those left we are tasked.

The waves are cresting but can we be drowned, oh immortal self?
Delve deep and find a sliver of joy, a ray of sunshine to hold onto - don't leave your feelings left alone upon the shelf!

Rather than wane, let your loved one guide you in ceaseless toil from behind the veil.
Let her spirit lift you in a 1000 daily acts of love until you are once again hale.

Remember the struggle and the gold you found at the end of the rainbow.
Relive the good and bad from your past until the melancholy lets up from your brow.

For it is writ that just as we found our way to joy in our conflicted past.
So too we will find release one day, for we built an ark that can weather any storm - one that's built to last.
