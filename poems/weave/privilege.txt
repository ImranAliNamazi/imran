Privilege is…

To be loved
To be safe
To feel sated
To have purpose

To feel joys
To be strong
To be sane
To expect from life

To have education
To live well
To dream
To rebuild

To be mobile
To be receptive
To question authority
To ponder deep

To feel pain
To heal
To share a mission
To chase perfection
