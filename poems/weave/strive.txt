Let's striving for a better tomorrow. If I have seen far, it's by standing on the shoulders of giants such. Like the [Howard Roarks](https://www.panarchy.org/rand/roark.1943.html) and other Forerunners.

This Bard says, what can I do to comfort you
The trick is in running the race well, never feeling blue.
Sometimes we fall, or feel disheartened for a while,
Then a spirit comes from within and we win the last mile.

I too have said a lot over the years, but what can we do for humanity
Whose ears are sealed to the call? Woe unto them for not hearing our sanity.
I guess in the grand march of time, we need faith in the divine plan.
It's hard to see the Godhead because we look for it in the gross and become wan.

I guess the Kingdom can be won if we journey within,
So chin up my dear, heal yourself and let out a mischievous grin.
Wage a war with the callous with your heart, your wits and your smile.
For if we go down fighting not defeated, our time would have been worthwhile!

With much love,
Imran
