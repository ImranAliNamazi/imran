Most of my loved ones are beyond their prime,
In the eyes of the world they each seem beat!
I wonder if to heal them in this life, there's still time,
We never know when we'll have to vacate our seat.

We go on while there's still life beneath the sun,
In hope that we havent yet drunk to its dregs of life's woes.
I regret that our best years are past, we've already done having fun,
As I watch each of them slip away, but hey that's how life goes.

Sorrow and joy, joy and sorrow, let them commingle upto your toes
A friend once told me when I lost my father years ago.
Oh Gary I'm sorrowful now, I'm crying and feel a sniffle in my nose.
Let's make the most of moments left I say, reminding those around that we love them so!

Another friend said sweetheart even soul stuff has to recycle,
So don't let the grief wash you away, rather hold on to your sanity.
So I think after I've driven them all for ice cream and they're gone I'll just get me a bicycle,
And go pedalling myself along this slippery slope, from intensely merry to utter insanity!

If even Lord Krishna needed some excuse to die,
Then must we mere mortals fear the gardeners scythe when its time?
Rather attain to immortality as we each sing the mrityunjay
When its our time, for to be released from this bonded life is the best way to end the rhyme.
