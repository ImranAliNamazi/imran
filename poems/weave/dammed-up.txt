The cutest woman I know and I, once saw a
painting of an Ice Castle with the caption
"Don't ever let your feelings get so dammed up".
My how we hugged each other promising so.

Of course that was decades ago and we're
Both a little more careworn and graven now.
We passed by in the street last week and I swore
To myself she had this facade on, full of bravado

[1st Person]
Oh love mine, it seems something is missing in life
And though what we had was a thing of the past
I ache to hold you and be glad for love's threshing
As the fibers of our soul dance rapt, enthralled.

Now I walk up to your bed and the years melt.
As we remember the years, the kisses and tears.
I keep taking you down memory lane until you cry stop!
Then I ask if you remember the ice castle and our promise.

[Woman]
It's not fair [bawling] to have lost in love again.
It's not fair for work to be so hard, it tears me apart.
It's not fair we broke up, that really broke my heart.
[Poet] I'm here now, where would you like to start!
