burning candles at study time
burning need for change
burning away all lower tendencies
burning sage to ward off evildoers

<!--more-->

burning sparklers to put a smile on a child's face
burning like clay in The Potter's kiln
burning the rotten, defunct old
burning to reunite with the Divine

burning to establish the Kingdom here on Earth
burning like Prometheus did that Humans had no fire
daivic days are coming
daivic cycle needs to emerge from the human cycle

daivic is satvic overcoming tamasic
daivic is rajas governed or merged into serenity
daivic is a terrestrial evolution of this planet
daivic is leapfrogging over the intermediary

daivic is the 200 alien species of the Blue Book?
daivic is a prayer that those devas will burn away the obsolete
daivic is the hand of our Precious Lord
daivic is the colloquy at Kurukshetra that will yet liberate mankind!
