[Poet's Advice]

All of us are beings of light and though we know it,
Shadows surround us and we're uncertain of the way.
Small changes to the plan can have us in a tearing fit,
But we need to establish peace within and say -

This or other is our decision for ourselves, and be firm,
Let loved ones come to terms and make their own choices.
Sometimes it's not comfortable in our own skin, we squirm
And strain as we adjust to find comfort amidst the noises.

But it's not easy when no one cooperates and drives u nuts,
It's hard to see those we love heading down a wrong path.
Can I really find peace amidst so many ifs and buts?
Will cooler heads prevail, and make of bad choices a dearth?

I still have so many dreams of my life, wanting to serve all,
It pains me to see my near and dear all fuming and fussing,
That life cheated them in this or other way big and small.
Please tell me there's still room for all of us to be healing!

[Poet Comforts]

Yes my dear, the trick is in breaking the flow of negativity,
And finding someone compassionate enough who'll say,
You'll recover and be a salve to those on the brink of insanity.
So trust in your Lord, put full faith and let Him show the way.
