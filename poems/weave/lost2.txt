We're just a few lost souls circling an oasis, dazed and confused,
But faith in a Cosmic Force brings us back from the brink.
So put your mind and heart to the battles you espoused,
And live the Inner Light, no longer lost or lonely - think

And your dreams will become reality. Just remove the fears
And doubts from your subconscious. Be excited to be alive,
Don't worry about the crests and troughs, wash away the tears,
Live rather the Life Divine, build a bees nest for your hive,

Then gather your tribe and let your benevolence and
Newfound peace pave the way for their progress on the path.
Still feeling lost? That's just a detour before we join a band
Of brothers and sisters that come together, and in wrath

Admonish the rest of humanity who are but cogs
In a machination not of their choosing or with their growth
In mind. We all need to stockpile love and warmth, like logs,
A stack of which reach up to the ceiling and warms a hearth.

When we find each other, we will know contentment and bliss.
So throw all your sadness away, accept the things you can't
As yet control, but never lose faith and hope. Daily kiss
Yourself as you wake and go DO something rather than just rant.
