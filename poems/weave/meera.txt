Oh, my love, my life, my light. It's hard to see you distraught.
We knew this day would come, so we faced it bravely as we could.
Loving you has been a blessing in my life - you taught
Me to be fully alive to the powerful play around, a thing we all should

Remember, not letting a single moment pass without courage.
The memories we both shared, took a lifetime to accumulate.
I am one with you in spirit, it is only my body I have shed, so feel not outrage,
At the manner I passed away in. Wake from this stupor, regain a state

Which returns you to the equipoise and strength that you had.
Be strong for our children, let them not over-grieve too long.
My love, my life, my light. To have had you in this Earthly life I am glad.
Remember we are connected by a bond, it's to me you belong.

Don't brood too much, we faced life with the cards we were given.
Who but the sages understand why this or other experience we face.
Now be at peace as I journey beyond the veil, by divine forces driven,
Look to your family and friends especially the bard for solace.

It's not easy I know, but my time on Earth has drawn to a close.
Look for a strain of me in all that you see and always remember,
That I am there with you in heart, you'd remember me like a rose,
A sweet smelling fragrance from your past - be strong, let your heart not feel rent asunder.
