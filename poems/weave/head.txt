The human race gurgles and jostles like a fountain,
There's forerunners standing as next to a mountain
To chop it down with the edge of their hand. We try
To be heroic especially in using our heads, spry

And full of vigour for we're in the fight of our lives.
Striving to move humanity so each individual thrives
In a divine tomorrow - why its within our reach.
So we hack and chop that soon our dreams will beach,

As they discover the light and we walk elated and tall.
Why the jostling won't be anymore a trouble for all.
Use your heads oh ye of the masses, follow not
The troublemakers and those who sow discord. Blot

Out the negative from your lives, live instead in bliss
That's your birthright so always remember this -
We're meant to live in harmony and know pure love
It's like the hand of fate that fits just like a glove.

Now think of the march of Evolution and those who walk
At its head - Divine Beings who think and talk...
Telling us to find the transcendent soul that lives
Knowing only unalloyed joy, being always one that gives.
