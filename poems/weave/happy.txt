Happy to watch life go by, loving every minute of it -
In harmony with the cosmos, always staying fit.
Peace is my natural state, I enjoy all the moments,
Filled with memories of my baby, oh the sentiments.

Recognition I dont need to seek, having had a splendid career.
The universe aligns and I reach to the stars, not having to steer.
The world is my oyster, In ages past I travelled its length and breadth,
Exploring my ways through nature's pastures, sometimes even cheating death.

Children I see but my own baby is special among them, I love her tonnes,
Joy she brings wherever I go, even when I'm facing the most excruciating downs.
Soulmates are forever and to find one in this lifetime I'm certain of, you see
God protects us in many ways - we just have to let his divine plan unfold joyfully.

Lord Krishna reminds us to celebrate life and live it well, as well as we can manage.
A little mischievous he has been, but always letting Karma work, writing on our little page.
Purpose we find, and its to ever expand our consciousness, fully embracing life.
Completely enraptured by the Lila or Cosmic Play, we learn what it is to have a miracle filled life.

Amazing the journey as we learn to face the ebbs and flows yet journey high.
Blessings come steadily, though sometimes its seems that tragedy draws nigh.
But if we don't enjoy this adventure, then what purpose amidst all this, O me, O life.
Friends we are excellent to and who teach us to enjoy the sound of a grand old fife.
