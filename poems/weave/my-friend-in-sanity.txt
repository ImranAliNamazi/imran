Thank you dear, for wishing me strength and sanity
You've been my tether through clairvoyance and insanity.
I hope the day will come when we help each other win our dreams,
The dreams we have for this pale blue dot, filled with humanity's screams!

3 days later, I'm still battling with everything,
Not going within which would learn me to sing,
I am just a poor boy, looking at [Golden Dancer](https://www.google.com/search?q=inherit+the+wind+golden+dancer)
Wanting it all, my destiny to master.

What of grit, we may ask the sages,
It means not to complain as a friend has told me for ages.
But it's hard to clamp down and focus when my thoughts run amuck.
So kiss this boy on the head and wish him much luck.

As he begins to discipline himself, something he's not used to,
Luckily he has the best wishes of you and a few other dears too.
I guess our lot changes all in good time, we've only to have - 
Faith in the plan unfolding, for then each new moment will be as a salve.

Healing us from the hurts of days gone past where we were dismayed
By this or other person instead of seeing God's plan well laid.
Im mostly healed now my dear, I thank you for being with me in tough times.
Now let me go out into the world, fill it with hearts that heal from my rhymes.
