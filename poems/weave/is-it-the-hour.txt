Is it the hour?

When we break the chain
When we get rhythm
When love will keep us alive
When we have no more civil war

When we fly up and find a meaning to life
When we relearn the courtesies
When we let our angels guide us
When we build a heaven, no longer vengeful

When history teaches us NOT to fight
When truly we forgive and move on
When we renew our faith in humanity
When we seek forgiveness for our trespasses

When philosophers keep it short and sweet
When artists inspire us to find ourselves
When engineers and teachers truly inspire
When a new spirituality rises from our depths

When the human instincts are hallowed and heightened
When our community is teeming with life
When our cultures and faiths join hands
When we draw [s]words together

Is it the hour&hellip;
Of the symbol dawn, when the very Gods awake
