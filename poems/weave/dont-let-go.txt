How can I let go a dream I've cherished?
A purpose and a meaning I've clung on to for so long?
I guess Kipling said it right when he said we should be able
To risk it all on a single gamble, yet be willing to start it all over again.

I needed you world, to shape my needs and desires,
And still maintain my identity through the mire of it all.
Let me go my own way now, lick my wounds and come back strong.
For enmeshed in identity games and flights of fancy - I've tarried overlong.
