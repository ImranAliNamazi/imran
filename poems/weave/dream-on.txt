Dear, dear friend, knowing you has been a blessing,
Which you are to us all as you go about busily humming,
And singing, and dancing with untrammeled joy.
And here, rooting for you and hoping your dreams come true is this boy.

I know sometimes we don't always get what we want of life,
But, like the lady that asked to be buried with a fork and a knife,
A reminder to us all to be mindful of what the Gods have in store for us,
If only we had faith in the process of unfolding divinity with no fuss.

Not that you fuss much, your indeed made of sterner stuff than I,
As your daughter will be - that “little laddu” who is the apple of your eye :]
May your life constantly be changing for the better,
As you will realize it has always been as you cross into another summer,

Let the seasons each bring you a new quality to savour,
So let's go out today and try and taste an old familiar flavour.
Let's reinvent our lives, show a plasticity within a steel like framework,
Let that steel be a harmony between self, world and work.

Ah work, an integral aspect of worship that we can elevate to the skies,
As we transform this material existence, rallying to humanity’s cries.
You've seen me in pain and with you as steadfast friend, I've started playing the game again,
Have we only known each other for a decade? Or from another age - I just can't figure when!
