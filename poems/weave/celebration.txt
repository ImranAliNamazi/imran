I am a lover of truth, a worshipper of freedom, a celebrant at the altar of language and purity and tolerance. That is my religion. ~ Wikiquote, circa 2015

Like ritual and dogma in religion, we're often lulled into seeing
The outward appearances of festivities. We go on doing
Things like buy sweets and blow baloons, but the celebrations
Are really about the indomitable human spirit which transcends all nations,

<!--more-->

Knowing no boundaries between cultures, religions and languages.
You see, we were not always separate and remain together in the eyes of the sages.
But this or other propaganda will have us eternally divided.
So let's be inclusive from now on, have our deepest fears confided

With this or other friend. Not just fears, but hopes and aspirations too.
You see, we're only mortal, and of years left, have only a few.
So have a good time girls and boys, let the indwelling God in you shine,
And remember to be together in everything - don't waste time

Listening to this or other leader or influencer who is a spewer of hatred.
Strive for peace within for that is how we should listen to the sacred
Flame within us which only wants to stockpile memories of compassionate acts.
So invite your neighbour to your festive board - fill him with snacks,

And delicious sweets as you both let your guard down in shared camaraderie.
We're all commanded to give of ourselves so let there not be any "difference between him and me".
Let me say again celebrations are to kindle the Spirit inside,
Uniting people and having them submit to the Divine that would guide.
