There is an Elder I know, shines like a Diya or light.
Carries a strong and mystical sense of our inner divinity.
Sensitive, she's a steadfast friend to each soul's plight.
Bombard her we do with a barrage of thoughts, seeking serenity.

<!--more-->

Forgetting that it's only inner silence that can set us free.
A gentle reminder to us, of the healing to be found by going within,
She lauds our efforts, exhorting us to dance with glee.
A glee that only comes from stepping away from the din

And the noises that humanity makes with it's pangs for power and wealth.
A mostly coarse and petty species, caught fast in the grimy quagmire.
But some of us toil to break the chain and restore ourselves to good health.
A smaller few remember the toil of this "star of light" that helpied kindle our inner fire.

That has now become an unquenchable fire that drives us to go pay it forward.
That world changing philosophy by Ben Franklin who envisioned a brighter future for us all.
Reminds us to be ever mindful of those around us, both cued in and clueless - all of creation heading toward
A blessed magical time when love will go out into the world - manifest to all creatures great and small.

Where do we go from here, you may very well ask. Once again the solutions come as we journey within.
So chin up folks - soon we will begin a mass integration - people over the world as one.
Having thrown off our aggression, lusting and sadnesses away, expunging sin.
As the riddle of life we've solved - serving the world with a fount of love - the Kingdom having won!
