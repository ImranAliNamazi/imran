Some of my earliest memories of my father are of good times,
Celebrating Eid, Holidays and Birthdays. Today I look at rhymes
That capture them all, and can be a part of my literary legacy.
You see this life is meant to be lived to the full, thinking otherwise is fallacy.

I remember him as a hard working simple man, with his share of dreams,
For helping the world - devoted firstly to those the Lord deems
As strong enough to have their faith and grit tested by circumstance.
I'd like to believe I've inherited some of his good qualities, and not by chance.

I dream of the day the world's stage will look at me trill and dance.
You see, we all have dreams and should remember them as we prance
All lively for ourselves, our families and the world at large.
Carrying the Divine Spirit through sorrows too - but also enlarge

The focus on the positives, for each of us is gifted with some blessing.
Now I'm off in jubilation to hear this or other rock star sing.
Make a difference in your ever widening circles humanity.
It's heart wrenching to see fellow beings in abject poverty.

Not only in terms of money but emotionally and spiritually as well.
"I want to give it all" should be a mantra to follow to make us feel swell.
I go now to celebrate the day, a gift to know we're still alive.
For global peace and joy and sanctioned works, we should strive.
