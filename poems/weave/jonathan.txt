Jonathan, O Jonathan... Wherefore art thou?
The 200 years have passed and we have made
A mockery of your love of pushing us to fly!
As I lift myself up, I yearn to hear your cry!

<!--more-->

Son of that Great Gull indeed,
Can we not send our children to Chiang's world?
That they may come back even more spirited.
Then those of us striving to solve the riddle of this world shall be,

Excellent to each other, learning from our youth.
We have 200 flocks or tribes as we call them,
And I wonder, shall we ever live on a Common Planet,
Create a Joyful Earth where we bathe daily in Showers of Blessings!

Oh Jonathan, my time is drawing to a close,
Beyond a few hundred feet, I cannot lift this body further!
Wont you send a band of angels a coming...
Coming forth to carry me home.

So much pain I have been a witness to,
Crying for all the atrocities we do to each other,
Marring the very essence and form of that indwelling spirit!
Come hither and lift me up, that I may love this world from heaven!
