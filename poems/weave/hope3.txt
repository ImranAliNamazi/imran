It was writ that we will find release one day,
For we can build an ark that can weather any storm.
You see it's built to last, so lead on the Divine Play
As it plays out in your kaleidoscope - so sing out strong.

Sing of Happy, not Sad. For when sadness overtakes us,
There is a blotting out of the Sunshine from our very lives.
Rather, make do with the limited energy we have, without fuss.
For when we let in the sunlight, it shines and we can once more take dives,

As we plunge ourselves into a plethora of activities,
Feeling ever more intimate with the cosmos in it's splendour.
Hope on mate, life may not be a bed of roses, but do enjoy the candies,
As we all learn to be childlike again, filled with the Eternal Dreamer's wonder.

You're all broken inside afraid to dream again...
Or can you find the restorative powers of mending,
And be healed as you take up the yoke of life with no disdain.
You see pain only carves deeper wells in our being.

You may feel trapped and need an outlet, or look for someone to blame,
But know this Dear Kim, you are much loved and for a while were ensconced in bliss,
Inspiration and love will not cease to seek you all the same,
So chin up and find your way to lead the Life Divine, guided by that Infinite Radiant Is!
