I dreamed of you this week, with that delectable smile
That I fell for and that sweet voice. How, in a short while,
Our love had started growing on its own- something fierce,
Whose intensity still touches deeply after all these years.

I remember our promise to be open and the poem I wrote you last,
When you were all dammed up inside, thinking of the past,
And how the joy in our lives has faded to almost nothing.
I remember dearly the way you'd have me in stitches, laughing.

Oh Pat, I remember goofing things up a long 15 years ago,
How you forgave me and we remained close and though
I longed to have you forever, it's now a decade since we met.
You went away shutting me out in the rain, cold and wet.

I know we still speak now and then but it's not the same,
That gurgling laugh that I fell for still drives me insane.
Loved by many I may have been but our's was especially meaningful.
Now most days find me just somber and all too thoughtful.

I guess the ships have passed though I remember sailing
At your prow, our bodies as if as one, our hearts a racing.
Do stay in touch and let me know if it gets lonely out there.
I can get there from here, for the road cannot lead nowhere!
