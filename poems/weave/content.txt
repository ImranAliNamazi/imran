There is a fine line between ambition and contentment,
We would apply our logic and think they're exclusive,
Whereas this Old Indic Wisdom is certainly bent,
On telling us to give our best yet live

Not worrying about the reward. So show ambition
In the largeness of the works we take up,
But worry not for praise or reward, a caution
For these bring expectation for this or other gift to fill our cup.

It's tricky not to expect something for our labours
Big or small. Can we really shed the ego that demands reward?
Count your blessings and you will be more content with the passing hours,
Yet not have done little for your ambition would have taken you toward

A grander purpose of life that would have us serving our Lord.
I hope I'm not confusing you, I said the line was indeed fine.
There's tension when we expect something, but only accord
When we put away thoughts of recognition, so walk the line.

There is nothing in life more fulfilling than feeling content,
As when a child grows another year older and raised well.
So dear friend, pick your ambitions but watch how your energy is spent,
For if done well, you'll have the joy of having put us in a spell.
