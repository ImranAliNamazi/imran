Oh dear friend, I hope to find you in good spirits,
I've been brooding a little this week and could do with a lift.
But enough of me, I really just wanted to celebrate you
And your calm resolve in the face of all storms.

I hope this year you reach that inner equilibrium
That you've been striving for these past years.
I always admired you for how close you came
To finding perfection in life, how you strive all the same!

I hope that once more you will let someone in
To your heart, who'll make you grin.
It doesn't have to be romance, may even be a girl,
But never let your spirit flag, joyously let your flag unfurl.

I hope you know my dear that you mean the world to me,
You helped a broken man through his worst, find that inner glee.
I must thank you for being steadfast in friendship.
Now time for you to dance? As you take the wheel of your ship.

I hope you remember how to steer her and kindly too,
Still madly in love with you I know we'll always stick like glue.
Now dream of the stars as your daughters you do raise,
As for me, I'll always remember the times you guided me in oh so many ways!
