They say after all the chasing and breaking and heartache,
That we will find that the one who understands and loves us the most
Is ourselves, so don't worry too much about the world dear friends.
There will always be that someone more to please and appease.

Focus rather on whittling away at yourself,
Turning the discord and rivalry of your elements
Into a harmony that permeates the sphere
Around you. Facing life on your terms and

Laughing at the niggles and the lifts.
Can we build a community of souls?
Simply teeming with life?
Fearless in the elements?

Go towards a new day breaking in the east.
A resplendent dawn, the final breaking out,
That Fighters and Forerunners have been
Establishing. Awaken that builder inside,

And render every bit of negativity to
A quiet dissolution in the cauldron of life.
Go now, find something that resonates with you.
I go to my Premakshetre, to work in worship to the One Absolute Parabrahman.
