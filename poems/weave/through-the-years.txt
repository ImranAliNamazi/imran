I've always felt a delightful spirit inside you,
Oh dear friend did we really have to bid adieu?
Won't you believe me if I said it's beside you I belong?
So come back and waken my stupor with a song!

Through the years my love has stayed pristine and pure,
Say we can be together and I'll love you even more.
I remember the days when you would talk to me,
And in delight to have your love, I'd go whee...

Golly gee, how the years have now flown away,
I wish I had the courage to just call you and say,
Won't you forgive me dearest, I'd be your lifelong friend,
Just say we can go back to the start and I'll be on the mend.

I know that of the two I'll always love you a tad more,
Come back my dear, lets give in to love's threshing floor.
A woman you are to ride beside in storms and sunny weather,
Your friendship I'll want, from now on, until forever.

I know I ruined things but believe me when I say,
I now know your boundaries and wont ever make you feel dismay.
I hope we both love one another enough to wish for the best of romance,
Though not with each other - so give me a call and let's again dance!
