The pluralist in me is like a mother caught in a fight between her beloved children,
You see they've been brought up by different fathers who would
Blindly believe the voices of the myriad pulpits each orchestrated by the Devil himself,
To drive a wedge between us of this Earthly Family.

If a sermon does not urge us to lay down the weapons and act inspired by love,
Then it's part of propaganda*, I mean how can Priests bless troops
Being asked to go kill, and be endorsed by God all the while?
I thought with our spiritual awakenings that we were safe, but now realize we should strive harder for a divine future.

Oh humanity! Until when will a pacifist weep while you rend each others breasts apart?
Did not Khalil Gibran ask until when would the Crescent be kept apart from the Cross?
I used to think the way forward was to talk of our theological differences,
But that's just talk and some lynching that could have been averted is not.

We are the world, we are it's children, so let's teach our children what it is to have a Dear Mother *1.
And just what Genesis means about God infusing us with his Divine Spirit *2
They SHOT the man who said Imagine *3 all the world living life in peace.
How shall we achieve Unity *4 if we're unwilling to listen to a brother, curb the tumults of his dogmatized rabid self?

There I've said my piece and I believe most hopefully in love,
A love surviving hate into eternity. Now imagine *5 if one or two of you
Could help us shift the conversation back to love.
Then we will all know what religion is all about - loving each other!
