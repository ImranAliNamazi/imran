My grandfather was a cartoonist in the magazine he worked at till 1975.
His wife would make the most beautiful 10 foot kolams on special days.
My mother was the most gifted of her generation, on fine arts she would thrive.
My sister, a decade ago made acrylic paintings that had us all in a daze.

2 of my mother's siblings, my sister and I also write poems.
A new kind of art where the word conjures visions in the mind.
What do we know about the artists who gave of their all -  streams
Of consciousness that if seen and heard, will show us a way out of this bind.

I wonder if my niece will be an artist someday... I longed for
A picture of the ladies of 4 generations to sit and paint - 
But that picture evaded me and now granny is not here,
You see, she's journeyed off to the world between lives, but did not taint

Our understanding of life's beauty. For we are all acutely
Aware of the underpinning aesthetic that uplifts us all.
Go paint my dear, let your soul exalt your senses until finally,
You are one with the Cosmos, turned skyward, standing tall.

I knew a painter (Niggle) - he was obsessed with the one big tree.
Everything and every thought was woven into it's story.
When he died and went to heaven, it was brought to reality.
So create art that mirrors your deepest longings and meditations folks - for that will become your destiny.
