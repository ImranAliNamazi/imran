In the evolutionary cycle, humankind is reaching for divinity,
So dear child of mine, know that your dreams can be potent.
You can make any wish come true so dream with glee,
And then put in your best efforts, fight like a warrior, spent,

Until your last reserve of energy is given to your task,
Then rest up and awaken ready for the next sprint.
Dream of reaching the stars, don't forget to take your flask
Full of magic potions that bit by bit you cross each stint.

One day you'll land on the moon and win some dreams,
So remember to give life your all. Chin up dear,
We don't always win, so don't dismally give into screams,
Rather meet life on the front foot, don't have any fear.

Care for your fellow playmates, help them keep afire their embers,
Perhaps life is being tough on them, so love them madly.
As you learn to be a salve to others think also of your elders
All deserve to drink from your cup, so welcome them gladly.

Aspire to be an Angel on Earth - something we elders forget,
Remind us as you show us the way and help open our heart.
But most of all, be kind to yourself, for with that secret I bet,
You'll help build His Kingdom, help us all go back to the start.
