Once in a while there comes a force
Blows to smithereens our notions

On what is what and how to fight.
When the enemy's arrows blot out the sun we must adapt.

By letting loose that berserker fury,
Winning the field with grit like our ancestors did!

Oh Hurin Thalion, let your wrath ever flow through me.
From sunset to dawn to even more dawns.

Long have I watched our kin fall dead,
Waiting restlessly for my turn for glory!

To meet the dark forces in their den,
As hell vomits it's hordes upon humanity.

A poets heart.. Crying a fighter's tears,
Now put aside the fears and doubts and let out a battle cry*.
