Time to dissolve humanity's problems in the cauldron of life,
Build a common planet where we can dance without strife,
Under the stars where we can BUILD better and better things,
A life full of daring and panache, for all earthly and divine beings.

Time to turn that page, as Gene Roddenberry did beg us to do.
Make of living a blessed joy on earth - joy for all and sundry, not just a few
As control everything - don't you wanna dance in the moonlight,
Having thrown all our cares away, on this especial day - rather delight

In the love we can share with our fellow creatures, love always
And always love, never betraying the fire at our kernel- the daze
That we're in for following our heart - a firm hold as we walk
Upon the rocky road of life, with the Divine guiding us - a talk

With the forces of nature and society - ever guiding us.
Come now Remzi, and stand to centre, for igniting the embers
Of an oft forgotten dream - to build a Haven on Earth,
For it is ordained that of love to all there should be no dearth.
