"So the garden one day set me free" we both said in unison,
Meaning we were like wildflowers briefly glowing together in the sunlight.
She, the elder had lived in troubled times, those around in sin,
And longed to leave this world, but in a state of nirvana or ecclesiastical delight.

I, the little one was a little unsure after years of tortured
Voices inside my head that constantly kept me distracted.
Will the soul contract end now, as we wish the best for each other, she like a bird
Soaring off into the sunset, experiencing quick healing for all her dreams thwarted?

The rest will be silence soon I said, time to help each other
Catapult into a timeless tomorrow, one that has been ordained for us.
Separate ways, or same, I do not know, but I took some very conscious decisions yesterday to quietly find my pace and swing and not bother
The loved ones around me who wonder and worry and oppose and fuss.

So as one big happy family, let's pray for everyone's release,
Like the verse Loka Samastha Sukhino Bhavanthu a missive that everyone can gey exactly what they want.
Release from the bondage of this mortal coil, rather ease
As we lift the Swan that is our soul to new heights, won't

You be looking to me to honour this request from you,
To realise I have been and can be even better, learning even to let go.
Infinite patience and love you gave me my dearest friend, now I too
Would like to go pay forward every drop of kindness - how, just thinking of you will make me know..
