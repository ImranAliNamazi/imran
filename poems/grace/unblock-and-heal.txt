I had only heard tell, what an autistic non vocal child would have to bear,
Then saw a girl with cerebral palsy diligently doing all her activities,
I realised we of privilege have no right to complain when with utmost care,
Our loved ones go that extra mile to see to our last sensitivities.

Oh, how I weep for the callousness that is me.
I'm reminded again about how time is running out,
With my mother, who simply cannot understand me,
But whose been a Guiding Light, even when I was blind and did but shout.

I found myself in an age old predicament today, where I
Wanted to understand a wall of text at a temple,
Angry at myself for knowing only the one language for nigh
On 40 years, too old to learn a new one - a skill

That eludes me. For some it's alcohol kills their abilities,
For me it was a sedentary life, ruinous sleep habits,
That over time turned into a mental imbalance, bringing me to my knees.
I said it before, that once were are back on our feet, we conveniently forget to love to bits,

The friends and loved ones who are still trapped in the quicksand,
Bleeding daily their life's energy until their voice is spent,
Hoping an Angel will come along, change their lives from bleak and bland,
Into one of health and courage, being a Salve to still more, another round of angels, from the heavens sent.
