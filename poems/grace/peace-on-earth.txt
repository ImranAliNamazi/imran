A chain reaction that IS destroying the world was initiated on the 6th of August 1945.
Time for new generations to spring up, push the weapons out of the hive.
We're mauled on all facets of health, humanity my friends,
Mostly spiritually bankrupt, so painfully that we pray it all ends.

Seriously we've cancers and vices and addictions that keep us lulled,
All orchestrated by the puppeteers who keep the numbers of pacifists constantly culled.
So stay under the radar my dears, until your splendour with words,
Can rival the idiots, the idiots who keep telling us to draw swords!

There has been a constant erosion of the faith our parents had,
Today everything has to fit into being rational, it's sad,
But when we lift ourselves to see beyond the rightness and wrongness of things,
We realize a new-found depth to our faith that the Lord works through all beings.

The Manhattan Project ran for 3 years, 4000 people and 2 billion dollars,
Ended in a lot of guilt among the throng of scholars,
Scientists and engineers always bear the brunt of military devastations,
Not just the armed forces, I really don't believe in separating these tribes we call nations.

Yes I remember well how World War 2 ended, even a decade ago,
When I realised soon 2017/18 would be upon us a time when we should forego
The wicked and brutal days of our bloodied past where we,
We're not excellent to one another as would reveal our Divinity.
