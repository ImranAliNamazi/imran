I guess change can only happen when we see through new perspectives.
It often falls upon the Artist to give us a strong dose of that - imperatives
That makes us question the relevance of our current actions.
That galvanise us to insist on this or other change toward new wins.

Ah, there, I said "wins," which usually means someone has to lose,
And in this sad world that is the norm - most of our views
On society have been subliminally programmed and we
Forget that we ought to be one big happy world family!

Thankfully music, story and all forms of art are a potent medium
Through which those of sensitive mind can combat the tedium,
The mundane, rather express love and beauty to offset 
All the negative things that hold us back as a species, make us want to get

A new lease on life, one of panache and daring,
Make us want to look to new dawns, dance and sing.
Yes even dance, to the movement of the stars, as we find our poise,
And live in a world untrammeled by our wicked past, rather filled with joys.

The journey to change is rather simple, we fill our children
With a wonder for happy days, an idyllic life, then
Give them a taste of reality - some give up for a while,
Some fight it and in turn become the flame, go that last mile,

Until their dreams are manifest and the world makes sense again,
Where they found the courage to go on, we dunno, nor when,
But they make friends with those who've lost hope,
And show them a way into the light, to never give up and say nope..

Nope I don't have the courage to fight for any cause,
I'd rather be a cog in a machine without thought to pause
And think what it is we are doing, nor where the world is heading,
But if we skilfully weave art into our lives, we can give other's lives new meaning.
