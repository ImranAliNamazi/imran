A friend beseeched me and my brood to celebrate life.
I always believed in a deep seated liberation even while battling strife.
Howard Roark taught us that beyond a point we should not care,
Rather celebrate the struggles and the wind like gossamer wings do enjoy fresh air.

There is an indomitability to the human spirit we oft forget,
A testament to the ages, the quietness beneath the surface - let
Go of your niggles my dears, there's rainbows to find on the way.
So, shall we rediscover the way from within as we relive it day by day?

What do we self centered souls do to regain our faith in humanity?
With the superficial mental dialogue, do we make a case for our sanity?
Chuck it all out, the adepts say - go show someone that you are there!
Don't be boggled by the sum total of human existence and look in dismay with a vacant stare.

What beauties are there for a deep pensive soul living in a concrete jungle?
A melee of thoughts, a sea inside - all a whorl and a jumble.
Little discoveries, little blessings, little chances to share a few thoughts.
In the grand scheme of things, our Lord who waits patiently for us to join the dots,

And demystify the meaning and secret of this existence.
I believe it was Kinnie who urged us to ever strive and make sense,
Of this life, expressing both love and beauty - a never-ending eddy,
A symphony of head, heart and hands - so.. ready, steady?
