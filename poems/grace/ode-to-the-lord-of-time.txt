"It was the hour before the Gods awake." said Sri Aurobindo
These Gods live within us and govern our ebbs and flows didn't you know?
It is with them that we rise, and without them that we withdraw.
Today, in the land where they live by the millions I'm off, to draw

Their essence into my being, a special day called Maha Shiva Ratri,
Whose words mean the Great Night of Lord Shiva, the deity
Who grants all boons, for in time, which he oversees, the goals
We cling onto and fight for are inevitably granted - goals

Not just for ourselves but for one and all. We believers In Old Indic Wisdom,
Know the future seems bleak to the many, yet still we fight for freedom,
From the fetters of control waged on this planet's past,
Determined to bring about a different future, one that will last.

On this very special day, a wee bit more special than every special day,
We're off to revitalise ourselves, renewing oaths to our Gods, praying to find a way,
That will make not only our lives better, rather open up the gates,
That let the bounties of heaven fall upon this parched earth - Lord Shiva waits

For us to come to Him, by firstly opening our hearts,
Waiting to see what dream we chase, true to our targets like a 100 unerring darts.
Rally forth my lovelies, dream of the stars and beyond,
Me, I'm just off to slake my thirst from a small temple's pond.
