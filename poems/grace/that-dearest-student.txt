There is a man, a living embodiment of a teacher,
He has taught, and taught many persons year after year,
That the secret to life is being karmayogins putting efforts daily
Into a synthesis of head, heart and hands, serving this planet gaily.

He's been with me in heart and spirit, always ready to support.
I'm thankful to him now, as I switch gears and begin once more to purport
To build a forum, a social network, as he once wanted to,
But that was decades ago when we didn't have the tech to make it so.

I leave him now to wield a plough and to go within and control,
The inner “force” of prana, with students scattered far and wide, why even in Creole.
He's always said to journey deep within and every now and then,
Comforts me on my chosen path, helps me overcome my chagrin

At a world thar seems to be circling the drain as the defeated many believe,
But another world is manifesting as sure as the sages do conceive.
Make the most of time, gathering rosebuds my dears,
Live here and now as you conquer space and time say the seers.

Now back to this compassionate soul, my guru of many years,
I call him now and then and he somehow helps keep afire the embers,
Of another loving soul who somehow failed his guru in his mission,
But who's been touched and will one day show humanity a future with another loving vision.
