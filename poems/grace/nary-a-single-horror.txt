This world is going to hell in a handbasket, or so the fatalists think,
These doomsayers find new ways to make us feel on the brink,
Of annihilation from war and any other problems we cannot solve,
But it's only Mother Nature begging us unite, show our collective will and resolve

The million things facing our planet. Well look into the mirror and promise
That as common decency would demand, we leave this world a tad better - so surmise
That everything's not lost, no matter how much the media
Makes us feel the death pangs of a culture that will yet survive through the millennia.

A Life Divine could be OURâ€™S TODAY, if we forgive and break the cycle
Of abuse - hangovers from our past that stick to us like a grimy treacle.
But who will throw away the stone and be forgiven the tiniest of their sins, walk along the shore.
Oh fallen brothers and sisters, the wide expanse of ocean only remind us to make safe the path once more

For those still walking but who are tired and stumble and cannot safely tread.
Large are their sins and it's easy to say off with their bloody head.
I said once we could build a brighter future with nary a single horror.
But we need to first leave off our hate for criminals, affected by their own terror

That drives them to bankruptcy of heart and soul, yes they too need our love
To truly build a world without hate, rather sit in a mango grove.
Rather exuberate a new world compassion that would make us feel
A new sense of unitedness, for surely then, this planet could heal.
