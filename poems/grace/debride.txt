Some wounds, when not debrided in time fester and leave,
Scars deep that hurt us in ways we cannot conceive.
Most hard to overcome are the scars of events past,
Made more poignant by entitlements we thought should last.

Saddened was I when a friend spoke of giving up on humanity.
The 4th stage of the Gladiator when his wars have driven him to insanity.
We each stand for the decades in which we are in our prime,
As brightest flame, is my soul stuff and grit beyond itâ€™s time?

Nay, just getting warmed up to the battle ahead.
A battle I promised myself would rage on even if I fall dead.
Am I committed to saving the world? Indeed - but the joke
Of it is, I can neither fend for myself nor my mother who spoke

Out against bringing children into this sad sorrowful world.
Here I am mama! And while we can never control the events that swirled
Around us, constantly keeping us off balance,
The fact that we're here means we're kept in the Divine's sustenance.

Let this be the hour when we draw words together.
You, of all that was good and wholesome, how you did weather
The storms of the last 70 years, Kept me sheltered and unshackled,
As one day, I will lay you to rest, the meaning of your life, to yourself unraveled.
