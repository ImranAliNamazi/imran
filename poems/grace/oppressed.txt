We intellectuals know NOTHING of being oppressed,
We see those shunned and silenced by a society that's fallen out of Grace,
We respond on social media thinking there our duty ends, but, blessed
Are those warriors who still carry the raw pain, in a race

To save as many battered souls as they can, knowing the urgency needed,
Before this or other woman succumbs to emotional distress.
Stupid are we chauvinists who feel power, that lifelong must be feeded.
No matter how pure they know our intentions to be, they stress,

In fear of being hurt again, so it's really hard for a woman to
Open up to a guy like myself, whose seen that distress first hand.
Even imagining what Oppression could do to to the few
Friends who've opened up to me about it, makes me want to make a stand.

But I'm not a valiant warrior, and the act of chivalry is now a thing of the past!
I guess by listening, and offering all the love and support I can muster,
We can just walk down a road together, a road of friendship, steadfast,
A tale, a flux of emotion, but, with pearls of wisdom with much lustre.

The endings when the victim of abuse - physical, emotional or sexual
Can find healing on this planet are heart-warming to hear about,
But many a tale ends in ruin, where the hurts are not redressed and they live in hell.
So tread carefully my dear men, else Shakti will have to silence us no doubt!
