I lament the passing of my youth, with it went my courage.
I lament the passing of my elders, with them went my will to go on.
I lament the passing of my past loves, with them went my gaiety.
I lament the passing of my heart, it beats no more and I'm driven crazy.

I'm bawling, it seems I've lost the will to go on.
I'm bawling, so many promises made when I had vigour.
I'm bawling, won't I ever know love again.
I'm bawling for soon the echoes of my lament will be silenced.

I had once many dreams of serving this pale blue dot.
I had once dreams of making my mother happy.
I had once dreams of being recognised for being an artist.
I have these no more, I just want to withdraw and weep.

I don't believe anymore we control how our tale ends,
I don't believe anymore in good winning over falsehood.
I don't believe anymore in having gumption to win the fight.
I don't believe we can stem the tide of our humanity circling the drain.

I used to think that I could not go on.
I used to believe we all had a divine destiny.
I used up a lot of good karma in only dreaming.
I guess now I'll know the miracle of drawing strength from nothing.
