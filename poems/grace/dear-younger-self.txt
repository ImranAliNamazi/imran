Dear Younger Self

It's hard to curb the tumults of our agony and our ecstasy,
But Keep Smiling, because, in the face of meltdowns even,
That cosmic mother indulges us, it's part of the game you see.
I regret all the uncontrolled outbursts of my past, the world we live in

Just goes on turning hot and cold, leaving us devoid of control.
Some few like me, theres a reasoning and honest reflection
As pulls me back from the abyss. Even the time I punched a small
Piece of glass back in 2013 should have told us all I needed a regular session

Of speaking to someone with compassion, not just a degree in mental aberration
Treatment. But we are never taught to read sign. Thatâ€™s why I promised
The world my children will grow up in, will give a whole rounded education
In compassion and control. The tumults we experience need to be phased

Out of humanity's collective psyche, else why would we and all
Our families have to deal with it. Every pain is of the fire in
The potters kiln, the crucible of this astounding thing we call
The human experience. That glass punch you might think put me in oblivion...

Funny thing I was sane enough to drive with a family member to
The hospital where I was telling the doctor all my dreams,
And giggling as I asked him to come be a part of them, now I call upon you,
To lead us to a better future, one that lets humanity drown the screams.
