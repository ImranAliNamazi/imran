Dear bought but well bought all these loves have been.
Dozens of scores of memories stretching back a lifetime.
I dunno if any will every come back and "work out",
So maybe it's time for "killing the past and coming back to life"?

The tears come in torrents as each memory yields but another memory.
I've catalogued all the feelings, and hopes and possibilities,
But now feel spent at the thought of starting from scratch again.
Oh I know life is not simple, but won't any of you come back?

Spent is a difficult emotion to process when you don't know the way.
But a grizzled love for life must help press the reset button,
Which looks with new eyes at every passing opportunity,
Waiting for the Divine Orchestra to play the starting note,

At new beginnings, I'd dream on, hopeful with each passing day.
And glad for those friendships that are cemented for a lifetime.
Ah, the time until eternity, to have the love of a comely woman
With passions to ignite and be ignited by, a timeless love.

I pick up the pieces of my shattered love life and plod on,
Finding the grace to interact with friends and special girls.
For some day I will not have a family of Elders or a woman special,
Then will I taste the dregs of the torment of Morgoth Bauglir.
