I don't mean to sound crude,
Please folks, don't take me as rude.
I tried putting other's dreams before mine
But all you'll did was reject the gesture and, in utter selfishness, waste both of our time.

I'm so frigging pissed of for daring the impossible,
Thinking that a <a href="https://yieldmore.org/legacy/">triad of helping</a> would make life tenable
I guess I've learnt whatever experience has taught me bitterly.
Yet I'll stubbornly insist on helping you all utterly.

But above all I'll care for myself as simple determination wills me,
You see all I wanted was to serve and now I'm strengthened by Thee.
You see I needed the reminder that it's a bitter lonesome lot,
Whose selfishness will get the better of magnanimity, or so I am taught.

But screw all the lessons, we're here to hew new pathways
Learn to dance and sing in true camaraderie, along beaches and quays,
As this or other ship comes to port bringing in the fettered and shackled masses,
But one day soon, we will win the day, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHuI_FWCoPU">raise for freedom, high our glasses</a>.

For we would have <a href="https://imran.yieldmore.org/feeling-for-others/">conquered our insouciance</a>,
Instead will truly delight in each other, merrily sing and dance,
For it is writ somewhere that the human spirit will dwarf that of all,
Why even the Gods who incarnate as human, to indulge in works great and small.
