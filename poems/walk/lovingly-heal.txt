Dearest Raji aunty, we all love you so with your grace and composure.
I know it's trying times and the road is a little bumpy, but hang on tight.
Your's has been an exemplary life that has touched many I am sure.
So Lovingly Heal, let not dark thoughts hold sway for even a moment in this short night.

The promise of dawn is always there, oh resplendent dawn.
Remember the strength of body and character you always had.
Now think of your children and grandchildren on whom you would fawn.
And for all there is to be done under the Sun, be utmost glad!

For your's is a special soul that burns extra fiery in adversity.
So even while there is pain, imagine a warm healing glow
Radiating from the 7 Suns inside, that cures any seeming calamity.
Most of all, imagine a dazzling Swarupa of the Lord emblazoned on your brow.

Lovingly Heal oh dearest friend of mine. For you are worth life itself
To many of us, you whose steadfastness in devotion does much to inspire
So many of us, who lose our way then have you remind us of our inner self!
Help with your warm embrace and guiding attitude, us who still perspire.

It's all the Grand Lila some of us understand but still the pain is real.
So stay with us and help us find the poise in life that you did.
The lessons of this Lila may be tough to master. I guess for you now, it's to Lovingly Heal.
So do so my dearest, get out of bed and stand again as we so lovingly bid!
