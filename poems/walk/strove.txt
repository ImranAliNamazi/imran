I asked a girl if she'd go out with me
She smiled and said wouldn't that be
Something special, to have and to hold
Each other unto eternity. Be brave and bold

My dear, we're not either of us in good shape
And I'd fear you'd wanna kiss and hold my nape
And ask to snuggle and spoon - when I'm done.
You see I had the love of my life, so am happy alone.

I let a whole year pass and again got to thinking
Wouldn't it be awesome to let this girl know blinding
Love, even if not the physical kind, you see
It never was high on my list, but I do love her madly.

If we got together I'm sure we would be terrific fun,
Able to help individuals their races to run.
There's so many good germs in me she'd bring out,
And we could be perfection, always gleeful and ready to shout.

What do I know of love - a poor kid looking through the glass
Of a very uptown restaurant - who barely subsists on grass.
Sweetheart ours is and could be a very special kind of love.
Think of this poor kid and all the dreams for which he ever strove.
