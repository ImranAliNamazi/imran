Dearest Friend Mine,

Perhaps you were right about friends giving us the world and family only demanding their ounce of flesh.

But Mercy and Grace droppeth as from the heavens, and nowhere are we called upon to be like the petty clowns that would rob this world of it's values and acts of kindness.

Rise tall and strong from the mire and be valiant in all that you do like those Medieval Rulers of yore.

Nowhere is it writ that parents, spouses or children have to be good to us, but that should not deter us from doing our duties to them.

Live an exemplary life, seeking perfection of self no matter whether the world runs hot or cold. Begin and end your days with prayers of thanks, not only for the universe - the macrocosm, but also for YOU - the microcosm.

Even more so from this day, until the End of Days, let LOVE be your driving force, your REST and your REFUGE.

Now go whip up your own prayers and incantations never letting doubt or dismay into your consciousness.

Most Lovingly, Imran Ali
