<!--markdown-->Helping friends out of their entanglements when all they have is love for their children and forgiveness for their spouses.

# Poem 1 - 13 Nov 2022

Dear Friend, DIVORCE is a heart wrenching thing,
Especially when you are such a compassionate being.
I can only say trust in the plan unfolding, and do right
By your children, one day they will know wrong from right.

Should they ever hate your spouse, teach them to forgive
For its in forgiving that we hew our way back to a place where from abundance we give.
FAILTH SUBLIME is needed that our creator knows whats best for us.
We will eventually heal like these life scarred warriors we see around us.

I would invite you to these words of [the prophet](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/works/the-prophet/) who says
"For what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger and thirst?"
And to remember we are but instruments of the divine sanctioner of our little LILA.
Life can be beautiful again, it's only the heat of the loving potter's kiln we are in!

Do not worry about being hated, our perspectives change constantly
And yesterday's villain is often glorified - does not the Biblical Barnabas teach that?
Sacrifice your soul, your identity like a child learning not to fear the needle and submit,
For there is a UNIVERSAL wisdom at work, remembering the desires of those who submit.

My childhood hero allowed genocide and mass public rape, but history put the
Words in his mouth to condemn the sin not the sinner. So now I wonder, did not good come out of evil?
Isn't the diving plan perfect? The Maya enmeshing, the COSMIC DEBT! Now I am reminded of my friend [Hans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPBBnTFzNeo), your countryman.
Remember as friends, this line will always be open for a [heart to heart](https://g.co/kgs/SGEG6v) with me, your former and future countryman.

Notes to my friend:

* Now you need to radiate love so you children can sense the difference and your wife realises that you only mean her well.
* It has always been man the explorer, woman the homemaker (even in the case of Sri Aurobindo and Mirra Alfassa).
* I would suggest have both kids together each time and swap back and forth. Else the kids will grow up hearing 2 separate stories, neither of which is the whole truth and feel estranged from one another because of it.
* Ask your wife to find support groups and if they start to vilify your with constant reinforcement, then ask them for a public healthy debate for the sake of the children.
