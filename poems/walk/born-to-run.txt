Hey dude, don't carry the load all by yourself.
You see, inside you is a Tin Soldier, like the one left on the shelf.
Oh what I'd give to see you all smile again,
Dance on these evergreen lawns and heal and be once more men and women,

Full of life and in the prime of your lives.
You see a mere 70 is when we have our full faculties, our minds sharp like knives.
So come on here and continue to carry the yoke of life, but carry it with joy.
Here I see my future children playing, and someone is needed to show them the gladness of a toy.

You see, the Integral Yoga speaks of a life founded in the right mix of Jnana, Bhakti and Karma.
And while we never got the mix right at home, but somehow through life's trials discovered a sense of Dharma,
Let's melt now in Nature's embrace,
Climb back into the lap of Mahakala, continue running the race.

Let go the pains, the horrors and the feeling of being trapped,
You see, when we look to the future with the Sankalpa to enjoy every gift she brings, it's as if a 100 shackles have just snapped.
Healing takes time, but most important is the decision that we've taken enough of a beating,
And are done with feeling cowed and despondent, instead will once again find our inner voice and sing.

What matter the pains, they are but the memory of a different time when we did live.
We should only be grateful for the road brought us here, through good times and bad, now come dance and thrive.
Dance though the bones creak and the hands shake, for then will your spiritual body know what it is to bristle and brim with action,
I promise if you but allow the Divine to work through you, then all our collective dreams will have the Lord's utmost sanction.
