I am gladdened for distance for it makes me keep conjuring
Images of you, setting about your day, loudly and joyfully singing.
I think often of the lullabies you would sing to your babies
As you teach them to love life, enjoy the smell of daisies.

Dear, dear friend, I wonder sometimes if you can sense me wonder
At the magnificence that is God's creation, filled with élan, tender
As once again I go on to weave magic and dream of a new spell
In the annals of our history on this Pale Blue Dot, times swell.

The Gods come over to witness our taking our first steps
To the path of our long cherished destiny - our footsteps
Firm as we turn to leap and run, and they applaud. We gush
Full of glee for we're now closer to believing and we rush

About far and wide and clap our hands together to tell
The world that the bad times are over, there's no more hell,
Many distances covered from our far off birth in <a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Cuivi%C3%A9nen">Cuivienen</a>,
Where sweet water flowed and the stars shone like a pen

Drawing them majestically across the reaches of the sky.
What can be said in testimony to the love with which we lie?
On grasses evergreen where daily crosses that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Old_Sun">Fat Old Sun</a>,
We run, stockpiling memories of love and doing for every last one.
