Won't we be there when the "promise of a brave new
World unfurls beneath a clear blue sky"? Yes Indeed,
You see the Divine Spark in us has witnessed a few
Cosmic events like the first flower bloom, the fall of a seed.

All the time egging us on, the Cosmic Witness wants
Our divinity to unfold as our flag unfurls to sheer heights.
But a voice within always pushes us back, it daunts
As we step unsure, our doubts denying the sights.

Ah to see the Divine Force in action is to peep
Under the bonnet of a fine tuned car enthralled.
Can we jump off a cliff, forgetting how steep
It is, hitting the water, touching nearly the river bed.

Fearless we ought to be in seeking our destiny.
Then a whole lot tenacious in following it's trail.
Dare to walk the path of your dream, friend, see
Once the self doubt is gone, we can indeed set sail.

Though we only met yesterday and our paths are unsure
I see a strength of conviction like I had in my career.
But I was chasing a transient thing, but you are clear
In your stand for a person's right to health, hear hear!
