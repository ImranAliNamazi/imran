Heartfelt these verses are for I am truly blessed to have
Not just a family, but a best friend with whom to wink
And share both our joys and our sorrows, you dear like a salve,
Mended this soul with comforting words, helped him to think

Of all the ways he should be grateful to Almighty God
For daily sustenance and courage and blessings such as you.
Each day we live we find positivity to buoy us from the crass and odd.
For blessings today in this seemingly harsh world may seem almighty few.

Blessed are we truly who wait patiently for our day to come.
Ideator me, Educator you, both working on oh so many levels.
Was it already last May we tried to work our dreams, bringing some
Level of fruition to them. Let's hope that the world soon revels

At all we and our band of brothers and sisters do who bring glory to this pale blue dot.
Blessed are we who live a life of purpose, and though they seem to differ,
It's all of humankind's evolution ultimately that hangs in the balance, not as we thought
That this or other is the true reason for our existence. What we proffer

As justifying our existence, is just a tiny fraction of the Yoga we do.
Those blessed who dare to not just live the Life Divine but establish it.
Big words and infinite thoughts from a simple man who says adieu
To the old ways, who feels blessed for a new day, and to have YOU in it!
