I'm sorry dear for always taking more than I gave
For being a defunct poet full of rant and rave.
Always wondering who'd amuse my next whim,
Failing to see all of you in true light, lives grim.

I'm sorry friends for never trying to fit in,
For not hearing your screams loud amidst the din.
For never caring what went on except for what's in my head,
For showering you with my madness not love instead.

You see I set out to make friends all wrong,
I incessantly spoke to them about my own song.
Not caring for the happenings in their lives.
I would cut and interject with my ideas like a million knives.

I'm sorry world I took this long to get it
That obsessions need a healthy outlet cannot be fit
Into every conversation where larger things are going on,
Oh, you humoured me world, for oh so very very long.

What do I do, the inner dialogue is so powerful -
I have a way with words, but none really wants the skill
Overspilling or spilling in the wrong direction was originally said.
Won't someone find the strength to quell the madness inside my head
