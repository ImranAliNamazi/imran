No more wars in the world- seriously stop fighting!
It brings out the worst in humankind - rather sing
As you walk with your lover along the quays and parks.
Make love to each other till there are sizzling sparks.

Killing is wrong so kiss, make up and break the cycle
Of bad Karma. We can heal if we daily let love trickle
From our mended hearts until we're all mushy inside.
Another bloody war and definitely woe betide

Those war mongers for they'll face eternal damnation!
Use a font of love instead for everybody's salvation...
Don't fall for the anger trap in this information warfare
Game which makes everyone bloodthirsty, rather care

For one another and love thy neighbouring country.
For battle reduces us to animals, so tell your Mantri
Or Defence Minister to put the bloody weapons aside,
Then slowly go and heal casualties from either side.

Oh humanity, begin indeed a new chapter in our history,
We've got the Wall of DeCeit to remind us another story
Is possible if we let go the righteousness and rage.
Come my much loved species, time to turn the page!
