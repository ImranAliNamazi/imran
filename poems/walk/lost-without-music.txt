There is a gentle music which hearkens to the ebbs and flows of our emotions.
It brims with the feelings we latch on to with all the might of our unfettered soul.
I'm just a silly poet who thinks he can help people with his silly notions...
That a few lines here and there can mend a broken heart, make one whole.

Oh dear loving, caring friend, there is much I would do to see you happy again,
You seem like a battle scarred lioness whose unable anymore to lick her wounds.
Lost without music, for she's forgotten true exuberance and does but strain
To hum a few bars more of life's refrain - hey let go humanity's grunts and sounds,

And focus powerfully on the indwelling God that knows no limitation,
Only unbridled power and magique unlimited. Dance in delight
And leave the sorrows of the world to the ones stuck in the past and damnation,
I don't mean to say stop feeling your current feelings, but turn gradually towards the light.

For at dawn comes sunlight - that red shining celestial orb,
That tickles Mother Nature herself, causes buds to bloom in obeisance
To that Grand Architect who orchestrates both our flow and our ebb.
Perhaps we're all looking hard in the wrong place instead of just being grateful for our Lord's sustenance.

I would dare suggest you write a book about a parallel world - what lies in store...
Where only your inmost desires and dreams come true
Let it be as a Future Shock, that mankind can bathe in divine light once more.
Fill it with all your feelings and emotions, but above all, stockpile hope that ye may NEVER again be blue.
