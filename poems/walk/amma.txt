I gaze upon your face Amma, lined with the memories of the years.
I think of the years stretching in front of your grandchildren and know,
That they will carry your spirit fierce through all their laughs and tears.
I see your face light up with delight as you greet the morning sun with your own resplendent glow.

As I've grown I've come to appreciate each moment with the feeling it brings,
I've seen you as the rock in our family, nurturing it with the love your husband bore.
I know I'll miss you briefly when you go, then look for your rebirth in surrounding beings,
For we can never be apart long once we've learnt enough of life and it's compelling yore.

The stories go on and on, weaving us evermore into the fabric of creation.
We think often of past sorrows and joys, forever cresting
As we snowboard the Himalayas looking to rock n roll on with elation!
You see, we're immortal beings, who since the beginning of time have ever been wresting

And grappling with the Titans that would deny us a deep wisdom.
A wisdom that widens as we learn to resonate with everything that ever was,
You see, one day Mankind will show up on the shores of Heaven, having won the Kingdom,
And live in the unsullied light, and dance on lawns evergreen and thick with moss.

If only I give but the 100th part of all from Thee I learnt,
I shall have spent my time well, have lived a life of joyful giving.
When you reach the other shore, take time to celebrate a life well spent,
But return fast for in your reincarnation will a spirit whose voice trills to the Heavens once again sing!
