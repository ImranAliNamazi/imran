Here comes Johnny; Daddy you've always owned me
I wonder where you will stick it, come most gleefully.
Keep inching yourself nearer, come blow your load?
Treat your b**** right you f***, stop being a toad!

You frigging toads think you can ride rough shod,
Miserable c**** with false bravado, ain't that odd!
You deny your inner self, keep thinking your infallible,
But will find one day that strength is in being vulnerable.

To hell with you and your s***, let me just now reflect,
On a life spent unsure, letting others usurp my intellect.
And keep me off my course, the one I was build to cut,
As I shape-shift and gather strength, get outta this rut.

F*** you all, I'm done with being held down, told I'm stupid,
Instead I set out to show you love ain't blind, for cupid
Intended us always to have our eyes wide open
As life rapes us, f**** us up while we keep hopin

For the day it will be our turn to f*** back,
And shake things up, not cut you b****** any slack.
But there's healing in time as we wend our way back home,
And pierce the kernel of bliss, for then truly, the word love we will own!
