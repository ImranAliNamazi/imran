My website says "I'm Imran - Programmer -> Dreamer -> Writer -> Doer."
Well at 40, I'm settling out to be just that - World Stirrer and Shaker.
The best of the breed, for I know I got soul. And I don't compete with others just myself.
You see, mankind has aeons and distances to cover, much loveliness to find and engulf.

So these dreams are but a faint echo of the dreams whispered by Authors
Of our divine destiny, who've stayed child like in the wording of possibilities for other members
Of the human race, you see we're tied together.
So let's all break out of our shells and prisons and dance together!

Shakers and stirrers who envision only the best for mankind are sweet
People who are often depressed or misunderstood, lucky I have friends what a treat,
They make life tenable, and give me hope to set out and win my dreams,
That a wholesome future based on fairness is achievable for all or so it seems.

Doesn't seem obvious because too many clowns rob us of kindness and spirit.
But dream on lads and lassies, propel yourselves into the Life Divine, make it
Happen for only when fully touched by the Gods and Goddesses are we fully animate,
So ponder deep the meaning of life, a shallow life on which we do not ruminate.

They say you know a man best through his dreams. I dream of bonding
With more and more people, and of them releasing themselves from pain and suffering.
You see the cycle of Karma can be broken with a single kind gesture or grace.
So, humanity, time to wake up as the Gods come to watch us run our race.
