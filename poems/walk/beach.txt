Tumbling waves back in my sunlit eyes,
How I remember my first sights of thee,
With mommy and daddy standing by,
And Frisbees tossed, awaiting expectantly

For you to come crashing down on me.
Making love in the morning sun in some
Of my earliest essays as I revelled in your beauty,
In your warmth with a sense frolicsome.

Oh sea, salty sea, open your arms and welcome me
Back, for I was your playmate in days gone past.
Oh beautiful whispering water, murmur you did to me
That life is short so to go make of it something to last.

Oh sand, golden sunfilled sand, how you cleansed me
Took away all the grime of a world past its prime, ugly
Are many of her modern devices and ways, but Sea,
All people have to do is bathe in you and delight to be free.

There a child runs laughing to the grey skies,
It's not quite dawn as yet, she waits for that orb of gold
To rise in majesty, herald the new day, as time flies.
Come humanity, take a stroll on the beach, stop feeling old.
