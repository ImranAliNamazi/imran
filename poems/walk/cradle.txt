Go to sleep my baby, dream on my dearest love.
Run and laugh as you look to the skies above.
Will you one day show us what it means to care.
As we hold on to the promise of days with fresh air.

I remember cradling you and singing out loud
Chasing away the bad dreams that had you cowed.
Won't you rise up and show us the way forward?
As the heavens burst into song and we head toward

A magnificent future as we build it brick by brick.
Ah images that swirl in our heads, lush and thick.
Baby hold my hand, I'm reminded of dark days gone
Past, so smile sweetly then determinedly lead us on.

I wonder at the whole process of evolution that leads
Humanity from the mire all the way up to the clouds.
Patient and vigilant as we look up and watch the rain
Come down as we hum the bars of this life's refrain.

Friends you will have who will brighten your day
As the dawn breaks through the clouds and we sway.
Remember us as you journey to lands wide and fair,
Breathe in deeply as the Earth washes away the care.
