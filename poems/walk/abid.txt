I met a couple, they seemed very sweet
Their son delights in things, what a treat
He is to see as he dozes peaceful as a dove,
Oh what wonder to have a partner to love.

It's their 5th anniversary today, oh wow
I wish them everyday to be in total awe
And surrender to all that this life brings,
Make sure their son dances and sings 

As he goes through life discovering
What it is to keep on conversing
With the indwelling spirit who knows all,
Holds life sacred - even big and small.

Oft times partners are welded to each other
Until eternity, they really do stay together!
We single guys know it's something special
And know in our hearts that one day, we shall

Have a partner too to have and to hold,
To enrich each other as we grow old,
For what does age bring but a widening
Of our hearts, so dance, celebrate and sing.
