Greetings my dearest friend and very special girl.
I've been thinking lately of all you and Amma did for me.
A whole year of Sunday dinners where you'd lighten my soul.
Now perhaps it's my turn to spread mirth and be

A source of delight in that special home you've made?
I know a sliver of the joy my parents had when we were young.
I'd love to share my love for writing with Niha for it's a shade
Above the average, ah what stories and emotions have sprung!

Hey there friend, life comes with it's share of ups and downs,
I remember disappointments from the past but how you held through.
We dream of this or that but it's as if the universe is run by clowns,
Who delight in tripping us up, this time just go and hew

Your path until you are living your divine destiny - now do it!
For life has no set goal, is only metred by how we face our lot.
Fight every day and someday you'll have the poise, so git
Up and walk the path into the sunlight, be like a spot

Of light bright as the sun. Now Shobi, let me wish you.
A pocket full of dreams, a heart full of love... So go on
Dreaming my dear. Of those who deserve much there are a few.
Please let your dreams come true, vivant like a splendid dawn.
