My most wonderful Mother - you have been a beacon to us all,
Guiding us from the start, in all things - whether great or small.
What secrets of life you know and how you amaze us with your grace,
You've often been dealt the Jack of Spades, but come out shining with an Ace.

Ultimately we all will attain to Mrityunjay and now, your victory draws nigh
Exuberant at the thought that your race is won, we nevertheless give a sigh,
For we humans forget the cord that links us is forever and super long,
But not I, for I remember the aeons we shared, bursting out with song.

What a fantastic mission your's was, to incarnate here on Earth,
Of the Celestial Beings you linked us to, there never was a dearth.
I go now to comfort the family that we may not burden you as you depart.
Oh Mother mine, how the stars lit up by your gracefulness and your art!

Whether your journey is imminent or you'll inhabit this world for a time more,
We wish only to serve your gentle body, keep your memory in the fore.
My thought are flagging for a moment as I process all the emotion
But know we will soon dance to celebrate your victory... dance with elation.

Dear Mother mine whom I loveth so - you were indeed a beacon to us all
And it would  delight me to have you as a child in my arms, dainty and small.
As we renew our connections as we have with souls across this Earth
Now shine on and then come back as a fully conscious rebirth.
