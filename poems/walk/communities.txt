"I don't care" is oft heard but upsets a body so.
"Don't bother me" hurts me and is another heartfelt NO.
"I'm too busy to help you, so find someone who does care",
"Leave me alone", you say and just give me a blank stare!

Cooperation is the bedrock of communities so be friends please,
Sharing both labour and refreshment as we journey the seas,
Team-work is learnt fastest on ships where it's sink or swim,
Togetherness can mend a broken heart so do not be grim!

Love and Kindness will help a body go far to win people over,
And nowhere are we more godly than in caring for each other
Wake up humanity there's much to do after we conquer our ego.
I wonder after leaving our pettiness aside where all we'll go.

With love our Bedrock, often community is like family,
And often family grows large as a community - gaily
Do we spend our time looking out for each other.
At gatherings our elders let their wisdom be our tether,

For its hard not to go astray when emotionally hungry.
They cook us some spiritual food and we become spry.
As we share meals enjoying the company of loved ones,
We take turns telling stories about a 100 splendid suns.
