While we usually speak of exercising demons inside
And finding an inspiring muse, to, our verse guide,
We forget the value of the demon that strengthens us
And fume and fret and think of new ways to simply fuss.

For often in our lusting for recognition we forget to let
The pen flow, as lightning fast we free ourselves and get
Closer to finding that authentic swing that will allow
An expression of the Future Poetry, as The Divine in us does sow.

In an enchanting tale of travel across the worlds I once read,
About how consciousness wielded properly could have you led
From one world to another where, in some, daemons existed
As real life animal personas you could talk to and not be twisted

By this or other asuric force, they spoke to your heart
As a whisper of your soul or psyche, leading you to depart
From the beaten path and instead awaken to the inner light
Whereby you'd learn to dance in swirls and eddies, to your delight.

Enough talk of daemons and sprites and spirits that would possess
A poets imagination, lead him to daydream and continually obsess,
What these fellows need is some strong grounding in reality,
Where the stark pain of every last creature can be healed of the world's insanity.
