Dear City Mine, thank you for cradling me these many years,
Now it's time to move away, an act I do with many, many tears,
You see I have many loved ones here amidst your houses and streets,
Many an evening did I spend, thinking about future delights and treats.

I wonder now whether I'll love my new found land as much as I do you.
Home is a big word and I set off to make another, as to you I bid adieu.
Won't you welcome me back even if only for a short while if I'm homesick.
I've lived in many places but your special coz we've been through thin and thick.

Oh the friends I leave in your care as I trot to my new home with my old fife.
Especially the ones you took to your bosom for they'd borne too much of life.
I thank you for tending us your charges as we grin and face the odds again,
Wondering when the road will bring us together, we dance to life's refrain.

Oh city mine, just a few more nights I beg of you to cradle me.
As I wind down from my life here and plan a new life there merrily.
It's not without pain I go I have some intense memories of you,
How you comforted me on lonely nights, always kept me from feeling blue.

I remember your clear blue skies and your rain laden clouds well.
Oh for so many years your sights and sounds had me in a spell.
Dear city think of me often for you are my friends and loved ones.
Tearily I bid you adieu now for I'm finally off to see other suns.
