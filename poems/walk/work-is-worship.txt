When I was just a wee lad learning to speak - and to speak well,
One of the phrases I would oft hear was "Work is Worship".
I think somewhere the secret is to be present, taking cognizance of our own soul eternal,
For if our mind isn't in what we do, what matters whether we drive rickshaw or Starship.

They also say somewhere about filling the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run...
I've been perturbed lately for my buddy in college is now the talk of the town.
And everyone is upbraiding me for being less driven, but hey, I remember every minute and it was all fun.
It's not where we are at work, or where relative to each other or the top, it's about a race that can only be run.

Not come first or last, there are no such things, every flower blooms in it's own time.
It transmutes the mud and the manure into a calming, healing fragrance.
The road goes on, are we worshipping as we work our way across it, humming the bars of a rhyme?
And full of gratitude and brimming with much beatitude as we hold the Lord in remembrance.

What we oft don't realize when we trip over things repeatedly as a society,
Is that nature is waiting for the one who will act with utmost poise*, giving evolution a leg up.
For he will have shown love, and an inner tranquility that will set him free.
So next time you work, do it with utmost sincerity and not a single hiccup,

For its is only when we reach for perfection that we become the game.
And to play the game you must always surrender the outcome as Nishkama Karma** tells us.
Some people meditate on the ultimate, so two moments never are the same,
They evolve constantly, submitting to be instruments of the Lord, no fuss.
