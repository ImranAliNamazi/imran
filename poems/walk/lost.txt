Lost inside of you in my youth I was, for a good part.
I still remember how very cute you thought I was.
My best friend was then so happy, he said we'd start
A grand life together - now it's all gone for a toss.

I never understood why you went away, won't you tell
Me someday that what we had was of life, the best?
Come back dearie, cast me again under your spell.
I'd like to run this road again, our love put to the test.

Forlorn are my days, shorn of hope and full of grief.
I miss you baby oh won't you please come back to me.
I remember the love we had, spirited although brief.
Now tell me you're hurting too, open your eyes and see.

I loved you with my entire heart, am driven bananas
At the thought I'll have to face the end all alone.
What's the point when nothing is any bit as it was?
I wake up nights, beat my pillow and soulfully mourn

In lament for all the good things that, together we had.
I remember the day we met, your face full of glee,
I wonder at the years flown past, years extremely sad.
I remember you as I sit thinking of the times endlessly.
