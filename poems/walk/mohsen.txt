Incorrigible is the father of this lovely boy,
But exhilarating it is to watch him grow.
High energy we must have to feel his joy.
Infectious it is as we kiss him on the brow.

Smile he does making our labours worthwhile.
Embrace him we do daily as he keeps us dreaming.
Obsessed he is, but he does captivate with his smile.
Exhausting a mite, but hey, what other point in living.

Confusing is our state at the happenings of this world,
A world that is not gentle, kind or nice, but hey
We dream on, preparing our children for the whorl,
As in this merry-go-round they learn to mean what they say.

Naked we are in the elements, naked and fearless.
But grateful for the grit to live life on our terms.
Blessed we are and we give our all more or less,
And we feel full of life, growing tall as ferns!

We ride the wave of joy to the crest of our elation.
Shade giving as ferns this boy does remind us,
Of all that is wonder in this odd compilation
Of life's experience that we enjoy without fuss.
