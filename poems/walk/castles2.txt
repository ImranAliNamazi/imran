Wowie, that castle I promised is finally here on Earth,
I've set a fire there to burn, there's a rug on the hearth.
There's pages to announce our betrothal to the masses.
The fire burns on, as we make love it crackles and hisses.

I look forward to the day when our children can be heard
As they rush from this room to that, as they're steered
From one joyous moment to the next where flows deep
The river of life, in which they'll learn to dance and keep

Tune. I think of my earliest memory of you, a treasure
You are, sweetest heart I love you without measure.
I'm old and half worn now, but it's never too late
To enjoin our lives, start writing with a new slate.

A story of love woman, you make me feel so complete
In your arms. I always remember how I'd do any feat
To keep you looking in my direction, timid and shy was I,
But I loved you greatly, you were the apple of my eye!

Let another decade fly and my heart should overflow,
With memories accumulated, your kiss upon my brow.
The castle would be empty without you as queen,
So say yes quick, let our love glisten like a sheen.
