You know, my father knew he was dying.
You see he wore a pacemaker the last 2 years.
I think of his fear and unspoken words and end up crying.
You know we're never taught or made to talk of our deepest fears.

He saw a miracle man Dr Fazl but could not understand
The compassion with which he asked us all to truly submit
And watch the healing forces of the creator, who could cause a strand
Of new understanding to hold us to a higher truth, and sit

Back and watch as the life energy spiked, returning him to good health.
But that was not be be my father's lot. Today I believe in speaking
And choosing the time and place for those doomed to death.
You see, a soul's mission is complete upon death, so face dying

With a little logic, compassion, humour and much love.
Do Not Resuscitate only puts guilt on the family member,
Leaves affairs unsorted, things unsaid, and though we all strove,
There's nothing like seeing a loved one being cheerful and going with grace.

Or so I would imagine. You see I've only seen death twice.
But I still remember The Sea Inside, and recently a friend asked me to take up the cause,
So here I am wanting to listen to your story... And as for advice,
All I can say is know your options and take an informed decision, and give conventional medicine a pause!
