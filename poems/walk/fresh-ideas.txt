Georgy had it right, the working class did all the work,
Took home just enough to stop from going berserk.
Were shit scared of ending up like the homeless,
So operated all the capitalistic machinery, yes

They did not have the luxury nor could they openly
Endorse Game B means and apparatus like WE
Offer you, namely Creditism. See how it's credit flows
To all fairly. I sit back in wonder Remzi, to see how this goes.

How far and how wide it's premise is heard falls to us,
But Humankind seems ready for fresh ideas, that's a plus.
I wrote last year that the time can be even now,
So shall we let it take it's fledgling flight, watch its followers grow?

You said the math is simple and pristine so give us a sample,
So laymen like us can learn to see it in action, like a magic pill
That will solve the riddle of this world, make us dream of a "one world" where
All seers and poets imagined, from whose breast love sprung up, who'd care

A lot to see this world be fair to all the downtrodden.
But there's forces working to the contrary who keep prodding
Us with cattle prods to make sure we stay subservient.
Let's change to Game B immediately, as Mother Nature tells us it's now convenient.
