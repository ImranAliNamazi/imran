"Sing bhajans in prayer with Paati every morning
As a strand of the divine to this earth you bring".
Thus was my request 4 years ago when I thought
Of you, now look at the good things you've brought

Into the world with your sweet innocence and ways,
Agent of that Infinite Dreamer who leaves us in a daze.
What dreams are gripping you this bountiful year?
Do you wonder if you will get them all my dear?

Remember 'tis best to surrender the outcome and wait
Patiently as you put in effort, keep improving your state,
For when our actions will be rewarded only Lord knows,
So wait on kanna, remember highs are mixed with lows.

I do say on this joyous evening when life shines bright,
That we wish you the best, that you dazzle like a light.
Do know that we adults sometimes get upset with life,
Cause we forget to be as children, play loudly our fife.

But you, you should know bliss and light the way
When you can, for we must be good to all I say!
Now run along dearest, it's time to go to bed,
Be a dear and think of us adults and all we've said.
