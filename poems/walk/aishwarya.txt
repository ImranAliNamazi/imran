Six years of delight it's been from the day I felt your first kick.
I watch amazed as you wield a brush, painting greenery lush and thick.
I stand back, trusting, my love, that you will find a way through it all.
Find happiness as is your birthright, delight in works great and small!

Be loving to all as you delight to make us laugh and forget our tears.
Tell the world that it's wondrous, to let go our greed and our fears.
Dogs and cats send you into raptures and they see a quality in you,
I think in time you'll have dozens of them who keep us from being blue.

Dream of great things and the people you will touch with your art.
I smile at the memory of you immersed in a swirl of paint. Start
Telling us the story of your paintings and the emotions they bring,
But above all, live an enchanted life as you mellifluously sing.

You are fiercely independent and sure about your wants and nots,
So live with that clarity but don't forget to have us in stitches and knots.
You come to life when it rains, delight to splash in the mud and dance,
Your voice as you sing in devotion to the Lord, has us all in a trance.

You prance in glee as you spend your time looking for a rainbow,
Then you remind us what it is to seek for a goal, sure-shot as an arrow.
People will tell you that life is about putting up with and giving in to misery
But don't let their lie influence you, just pep us up as you sing merrily.
