We live in a Beautiful World sang the band Coldplay,
But nobody remembers cause all of us simply forget,
As each of us runs our marathons, wake up I say!
Become intellectual runners and karate men, be fit.

Go to work regularly, for as they say, Work is Worship.
Praying to God regularly can bring peace as we surrender the outcome.
I say not only continue not watching TV, but omit all news and gossip.
Love that dear grandson Aarav, school him well that he may become.

A delight to his generation, holding high the flags of his forebears as he goes Whee!
Children are like plants that we lovingly take care of every moment we can.
I know you don't like him eating non-veg, so convince him patiently,
That one day all of humanity will treat every animal and plant with Élan.

Now as this poem draws to a close, let this bard, of his words, share a few.
Some high wisdom it is to accept the good as we rout out the bad.
For ever and anon we are called to fight the good fight, not spew
Hatred or lies, no matter the silly thing that causes us to feel mad.

But yours is a peaceful life I'm sure you learnt that long ago.
If ever you need a feeling or situation articulated you have but to call.
Life finally calls for us to have poise and a shedding of the ego,
As we revere all things beautiful, with creatures great and small.
