It's many ages since you yelled at me for being nuts
But I remember it all now as a simply getting me out of ruts
What can I say kanna except - I've grown up a little
But afraid to come back and have you test my sense and mettle.

Nearly seven years since you and amma took me graciously in
Gave me a shoulder to cry on, a quiet moment amidst the din.
Oh friend mine, there is still much strength I gather from you folk
As days fly by and brings sentiments that makes me gleeful and choke.

Oh dear girl, I remember you as resilient, encouraging and patient.
With arms wide I look forward to our next meeting where I'll be rather silent,
As I make up for saying everything on my mind, Oh I remember the days,
When I had few friends and how you're patience left me in a daze.

I was quite thrilled to have a friend accept me though broken down I was.
Now I remember you, and that other friend - Oh how I grieve for your loss.
Then realize you are probably made of sterner stuff than sentimental me.
Those arms are still open, wondering when we can just be.

How wonderful it was to have your friendship - like a godsend it was.
In fact you were goddess sent, for a dear friend introduced us.
18 months later, we're still thick as theives.
Now time to show the world what we have up our sleeves!
