"Macha I gotta run, am with my daughters at a party"
Was what he said to me - Samir one of my besties from School.
2 little angels he and his wife are raising, sweet ain't it, they dance and go whee.
Life gets tougher all the time and bosses who simply don't care are way uncool!

Let's cut back to my typical work engrossed family man friend.
I wonder if you guys are really happy or often overwhelmed?
If I could say something, it's this - don't let life drive you around the bend.
Go with glide in your stride instead, always wisely your time do spend.

We're all 40 now or nearly there and though a friend says all we have left is a good 10 years
Before it's all downhill after that, I say fight for any cause you will.
For in the end, we're all cannon fodder in capitalistic economy with no chance to use our spears.
I say indeed, be like Gandalf the White, let's let their figurative blood too spill.

We're in the fight of our lives, a new generation that lives on consumerism.
No one's ready to wake up and rock the boat or to build a Field of Dreams.
We need to establish a Life Divine but first live it unilaterally without schism.
We know the formula for world harmony and no disequality, but no one is planting it's seed it seems.

The bard is free to comment on what he pleases, no thought or vantage point is off limits.
He doesn't know how hard is this dog eat dog world.
But were all crashing and burning into each other by Nature's design, so be it
That one day we'll dance on a Common Planet and LOVE will have us all awhorl
