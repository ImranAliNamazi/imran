And you'll strain once again to the sound of the gulls
But for now you've been put to pasture my dear oldest friend.
You meant more to me than life itself and I still remember that night near on 20 years ago with it's lulls,
When I heard first the despairing cries of a man beyond his prime, who couldn't fend

For his mother though he loved her most valiantly until the very end.
Comes another memory of the night you lay Comfortably Numb.
Much have you loved the world and it you, though you drove each other around the bend,
I'll always rue the day you give up completely on life and lay there inert and dumb!

Won't you hearken now as those Heavy Horses once did?
Moving the ground under me, as they recall the glory of days past.
Break the Chains that bind, prise open the cask's lid
And strain once again, this time moving sure-footed and lightning fast.

For as sure as new life courses in your veins, you'll build a legacy to last
Through the ages, though in my mind I'll always visit the monuments you built
And then destroyed, for in your folly, you identified much with Rudra who always killed the past.
Enough of that now, have you forgot Brahmanda or the one who sustains and doesn't let anything wilt?

Oh incarnate of that Divine Teacher who was to me both Guru and Deivam,
I would not have your labours of yesterday go all to waste.
So come join me down here as I learn to teach at Sangam,
Forever in gratitude for a lifetime of curation that has led me to, in utmost love and strength, make the most haste.
