Dearest girl, I wish you wonder to read the best of books.
They can fill your imagination, leave you on tenterhooks,
As this or other hero steps up and saves the day,
Give us places to love - where dreams hold sway.

Read subject books, for they give much information,
Also let fantasies capture your heart with much imagination.
I went to Fantasia once, in a film adaptation of a book
About the never-ending story, it had me by the hook.

It cemented my belief in the power of the soft spoken word,
That we children let conjure magic in our minds. A sword
I wield indeed as my words today bring images to life.
Ah, dear girl, much did I learn from books they are my fife,

My secret weapon as I learn to fill this world with love.
A daily battle over a 100 stories with the skies so blue above.
A blue that I will most certainly touch as I reach for the heavens,
Where one day shall fly, all of this Earth's denizens.

You see, the faith I have is in my heart, a feeling from a trove
Of a million stories where heroes and heroines strove.
I wish you happy landings as on wings you let your heart soar,
There's magic in the waters, so weave on dear, I implore!
