"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Old Time is still a-flying;
And this same flower that smiles today Tomorrow will be dying."
Dear Friend of mine, how the tomorrows stretched to infinity a scarce decade ago!
You were right, my philosophies were all sterile and puerile, filled with a false Ego

A wrong mixture of Sattwa or Illumination and darkest Tamas or inconscience.
Time to fully bathe in the light, use dynamism or Rajas to uplift the sentience.
Hey but all that is about me and my journey - I've found a good many fascinating things...
Like that sterile earthworm researcher Robin Williams whose now to lead a few Awakenings

I may never understand the dregs of society that mauls and mires us.
I wish your battles over soon my friend, that she stops 
trampling your heart and making a godawful fuss.
It's saddest to see malevolent parents cause their children to suffer under much duress,
Even more maddening when the other victim is the spouse, a grief that oft goes without redress.

Time I took a few pages from both your books for I've led a sheltered life.
Been challenged that I'll never serve in the trenches or uplift with my fife.
Why talk of trenches when today I can impact each one of my friends,
I'll quickly become a new Imran and show that he still can help a heart that mends.

We we're the best things that happened in each other's lives those many years ago.
I still need help with my dreams that can heal my family and liberate souls that'd go to and fro,
As they hitchhike through the galaxies, pass through worm holes and find
The backdrop of Cosmic Love that weaves magic and has us all in a bind!
