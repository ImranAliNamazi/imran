I'll need to be mindful and spirited if I am to bring
A child into this world, one who'd mellifluously sing.
You know, there's a new kind of painting on the wall
That adds a new flavour to our tales, helps us stand tall.

Am I talking of our divine future with angelic children?
Truly angelic in that they carry a spark of the divine...
A spark more bright than even our generations did.
One which will help them build a future more splendid.

I insist that you dream on dear mothers and fathers,
Strive to be conscious through all, be as worthy tethers,
That will bring your children safely past the point
Of callousness, rather into the light where they'd anoint

Themselves as they dive into new waters unexplored.
Now, in the present, I'm a young man with spirit kindred,
Who looks to marry someday and be busy raising
A beautiful family, with a wife that keeps me thinking.

I guess I chose always to live deliberately and suck out
All the marrow from life as I gleefully live and shout.
I'm still conscious of the present and every move is
Consecrated to the Gods who'd grant me utter bliss.
