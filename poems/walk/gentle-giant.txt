It's not because you're a little taller than us
But you ARE a Gentle Giant, who doesn't fuss
No matter how messed-up it gets, you'll always be,
Excellent to those you love, why especially me!

I don't often say love at first sight but we just bonded
Well straight from the start. You sometimes sounded
Me off for being a screwball at work, but that's over.
I do feel bad for those troubling times, you severe.

Few are as patient as you at listening and advising
Caringly. Much strength we gather and start to sing,
For in each is the song of life. Your's especially strong -
In fact it's infectious for close buddies who long

For the other's company. You bear the tortures
Of work quite well, also it's unbearable pressures.
You apply yourself well and are fearless at taking
Up new technologies - at roleplay you are king!

Dear friend, much do we love you, just so you know.
Your presence causes us to have courage and grow.
So when you feel down by life's ebbs just ride it out
Then the next day we can both dance and shout.
