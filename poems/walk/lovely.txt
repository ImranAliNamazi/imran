What for this life other than to care?
As we flush out the toxic - breathe fresh air.
Care for one another as we can do, with love.
Uplifted, as on a starry, starry night, we look above.

In conversation with that Cosmic Divine, and grateful,
For all the Grace in our lives - ever kind and thoughtful.
Life is truly a gift if only we meet it with strength,
And courage to strive on, go to any length.

Wonder at all the secret places where is found
The Flame Imperishable - our hearts as on a merry go round.
Wishing more and more that everyone should be
Enthralled by it all - content, as together we see

A grand purpose in all things great and small.
Guided by spirits past - in love they help us stand tall.
Touched by it all as our hearts are content,
A grand tomorrow is possible if to it, we're fully bent.

Have I said much? I hope my message has touched you.
For often times we forget to feel- those memories too few.
I think I'll go now and cuddle the neighbour's puppy,
As I realize that moments can be breathtaking - so utterly lovely.
