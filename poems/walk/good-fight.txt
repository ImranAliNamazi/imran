Once the cord that tethers us to our fount of joy
Snaps, we become ghosts of our former past.
I beg you friend, there's always something to be grateful for. So hang on like a kid does to the promise of a toy,
Waiting expectantly with each day until will come a time when with it, he'll have a blast!

My perspectives changed when a friend told me whenever she felt extremely low, she'd watch World War II documentaries.
I can't quite guess what exactly has got you down,
But imagine an indwelling goddess, whom, if you speak her language will answer all your queries.
I can play a major role in your revival... that of silly duffer or clown.

Imagine me guiding you now wouldn't that be a laugh :D
But impossible happens all the time so sniggle not.
Just stand up and start looking for your staff.
Then keep walking into the sunlight till you find a spot

From where you can watch the Good Fight go on and on,
Never sure where in the melee you should go,
For it's crazy to see man making his brother miserable - rather he should don
A golden robe and be his brother's keeper, let love everywhere grow.

Oh friend, I fear nothing I just said made sense,
But know that I love you and want you to be glad.
In my belief for a brighter tomorrow, I am rather dense,
So let me in and we can join hands and not be sad!
