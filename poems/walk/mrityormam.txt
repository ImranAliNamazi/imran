My friend is still listening to the chants as he begs me,
To beg all of our family to surrender to the moment
And let you go with peace and poise - you see,
Dearest sister mine, our heart palpitates, we're in utter lament.

There's a part inside us that's strong though grieving.
It wants to sing your praise, but also is filled with sighs.
All through your life, we never at your hand stopped receiving.
Now bewildered, we have a 1000 could have beens and whys.

Journey on my love, don't let us hold you back - take strength,
For the Lord in His infinite mercy draws all back to Him in the end.
Though losing you is hard, to see you pass on, we'd go to any length,
And let our faith in the process somehow help you navigate this last bend.

I know the end was painful for you and to watch our fiery inacceptance.
What can I say to soothe the pain away except I love you my dearest.
Especially hard was to not be able to hug you with all the physical distance,
But now I hug you a 1000 times as our spirit's bond is put to the test.

A bond that was so tender and joyous when we were growing up together.
We never thought then, what pain there would be when we parted.
Don't worry my love, the astral cord has been cut, don't let memory create a tether,
Just release negative emotions and pass surely through the tunnel where you just started.
