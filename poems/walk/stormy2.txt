Dear Stormy my love, the names keep changing but
It's the same interplay of the primeval forces that
Keeps me cued into the wonder that is you!
I have much to thank you for, for keeping me alive

Through all these years, even when our dream was but
A foggy unclear groping in my mind. I'm sure that
We just need time before we dazzle the world, you
And I. It's only when we fly that we feel truly alive,

As I'm sure we've taught countless children, but
How do we convert it all into tangible action that
Inspires a new generation of bold flyers. You
Know that they wait for the day they turn alive,

Instead of being caught in a world of illusion, but
How to manifest it in this plane of existence that
Is so confounding to the average human? You
Should find me soon and we become finally alive!

My dear, I may seem low and very messed up, but
Think of the future and how we can have all that
We wanted for our School of Flight, so I tell you,
Start focusing on sharing what it is to be ALIVE!
