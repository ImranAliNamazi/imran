I'm told the most tender place that a man can ever be,
Is the heart of his woman, oh dearie can't you see.
That all I want is your hand to have and to hold,
As my heart leaps up, my verse becomes bold.

Let's tread in glades and glens where the bird sings,
Trill it's voice in the morning mist where swings
You, as I would in slow movements that would cause
A smile to erupt on your face. I love you because

You know my inmost desire and it matches yours.
For from its long lost depths you hum a few bars
That your heart knew in days when you felt tender.
When you knew not pain, nor were rent asunder.

By the turn of fate that made you sit and wonder.
At the loss of joy - was that all God's blunder?
For you sought not sorrow, but found it anyway
Now I wish you'd open your heart, lead the way.

You may have known love but I have never had any.
Though I've been friend to a few, been loved by many.
It's only in your heart that I would dwell for a while.
Where I bask in the radiance of your beautiful smile.
