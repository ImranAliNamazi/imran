They say dying is like diving into an icy river on
A hot summer's day. We're meant to emblazon
Our truths on this life where our dreams held sway.
As we remember each experience, do we pray

To the Divine that helped us fashion our lives?
Let go the fear and dive dear, as one who strives,
To make sense of it all, of being a part in the play or Lila.
To conquer fear is to drink ambrosia or Amrith, so go on, ya?

Be valiant till the end, but surrender to peace.
Germinate Nature's bounty, but stay in ease.
The bond of love can never break so travel well,
As on this Earth we weave our own magic spell!

I speak of the end, of a Grand Victory to come.
As the secrets of life, we mine and we plumb.
Surrender to the time when our soul will recycle.
Remember there's angels, like Gabriel and Micheal

To lead us on as we ride the Stairway to Heaven,
Remember the worlds, of which there are seven.
Music can transport you to any of them, so be
Enchanted by it's flavour, then all the worlds you'd see.
