In days past we built a bulwark to keep out
The harshness of the world and its lower instinct.
We taught our children that love could oust
Any stupid petty energy, make their lives succinct.

Which century did not have us incarnate here?
Where we did plant mango saplings in Her garden.
And watch as they blossomed, full of cheer,
As each day Earth became closer to being Eden!

My love, the day draws nearer when we will be
Together again. I hear the pain as you call to the ether.
"Shasa, shasa, wherefore art thou?", you call tenderly.
And I say, search for me at the head of good water.

Our spirits have always been kindled when together,
And the centuries have been kind for its not always,
That we're destined to work side by side. O, ether,
Won't you make sure we meet again, graze

On a patch of grass on the same side of a slope.
So that we may grow in the melody of one another.
Good water! That harbinger of plenty, and hope,
Let me find you so we'd have each other for tether.
