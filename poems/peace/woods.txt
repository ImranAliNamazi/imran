Leave this noise and bustle for a day in a wood,
That I'd spend beside you, feel warm and good.
The girls and boys would feel a little hazy,
For a day without us may drive them crazy.

Much we love the people of this world.
Especially the children who make us feel whole.
Oh love, I'd beg you for a day in the woods.
We can just be! Let go our feelings and moods.

My friends would love to see me me complete again.
As with you beside me, I'd be, no longer in chagrin.
It's only in your heart that life would be tenable.
As in turn I hope you find me warm and loveable.

The hills beckon me where I would walk in woods.
Holding you beside me, each couple with their broods.
We'd delight as we took care of all the children.
As you have done these years, loved with passion.

Oh dear, come quick, the woods beckon me so.
But alone I'd soon wither, know not where to go.
The memory of your scent leaves me in a tizzy
Come to me, for then I'd know love so dizzy.
