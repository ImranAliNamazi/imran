My skin tingles at the thought of your sweet lips.
It's so long since I've wanted to hold those hips.
Come lay with me, love me and I would surely say.
That I'd love you all night, greet the coming day!

Ablaze is my skin as I think to hold you forever.
Now, for the third time is set, my heart - aquiver.
But those loves were never consummated dear,
Let's make love all night, I'd fill you with good cheer.

I think of having you beside as we cross any river
Do join me and on stormy seas, our ships we'd steer.
I'd reckon the years by the stars you'd pull down,
And my words, that whisper love in the light of dawn.

Love you unto eternity, I pledge with all my heart,
Now let's waft along the frolicsome breeze, Start
Loving each other as I hold you in my arms again,
Laughing as we splash each other in the rain!

Ablaze is my heart as it thinks of your touch
Oh baby, don't you realise that I love you much?
Catch up quickly my love, my life, do lead the way,
As on green pastures our dreams will, a course stay.
