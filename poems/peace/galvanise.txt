Galvanised we are not at the thought of loved ones departed.
We rue the day they left us, and fill the vacuum with longing.
What of our dreams and divine works we avoid, feeling thwarted.
Get a move on dear co-inhabitants - this world waits with feeling,

Trying to galvanise us into rapid and steady motion right away.
Those pent up feelings and emotions better left upon the shelf
Can be taken and bottled and used to let our dreams hold sway
Time to walk the sunlit path, give way for peace to the inner self.

Can we be galvanised by a poignant moment where we decide.
Enough of painful memory, disappointment and day dreaming.
Soon we'll be pushing up daisies folks so don't let woe betide,
Rather wake up from this nightmare past and stop screaming.

Galvanization can happen in an instant though nothing seems different,
Just a change in our outlook as we ride the escalator to heaven.
I may seem old and haggard, but I tell you I've much time well spent,
In daring to plot the reform of tomorrow, plant a veritable Eden.

Only trouble is I seem not Galvanised enough, but this is a Yoga
That demands patience, as inner pathways are hewn and laid.
Old ways are rent asunder as love conquers one and all, ya?
So find your poise and be willing to break ground with a spade.
