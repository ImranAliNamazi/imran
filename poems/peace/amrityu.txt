They say victory is certain for those of a serene nature.
Having been the love, light and life here on this Earth,
Do realize the goodwill you've spread to every creature
That came within your ambit, touched by your mirth.

Meeting again is certain for those of us who are friends.
Well, friend, we're connected by a love that radiates
As we walk the length of this universe, finding threads
That we weave into the Web of life as it illuminates,

Drawing us closer as only true love makes us tether.
Days with momentous events come hold us in sway.
Your departure from our midst which I well remember.
I'm touched by the warmth of your memorial today.

In 43 days has your soul journeyed and found a home?
In the lap of the Holy Father who sent you to be
A delight as we now let these children here roam,
Showing them pictures of you, for them to see,

The spirit that you carried through in all that you did.
That they may in turn mirror it on their journeys far.
Wait, guide us from behind the veil be again splendid,
For your love still radiates at the thought of you, so dear.
