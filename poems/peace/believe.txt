I believe you've always known just where we're headed
That you decided long ago what sort of warrior you were
That I have but a fraction of your grace and goodwill
Learning each day of the depths of your gumption and direction.

You inspire me to give up my past of vain self flattery
Instead walk in your shadow, fight at your side, retrain my thought
As the warp and woof of my constructs undergo a metamorphosis
And comes out refreshed by the tender and sheer force of your love.

I've always wanted to be like Hurin, who must have inspired the
Berserkers of old as they owned the night and wove the days,
From dreams their mothers gave them when they were wee lads.
Oh lady, won't you train me fast and let me walk this fell road with you.

I'd be called Smithson after my father, that other adept I know,
Who trod the length and breath of this land just being himself.
Which was sometimes as a beacon in the night, sometimes,
a harsh flare to light up the wrongs in our heart.

I believe dear, we have much to offer this world us two
And that you're the elder having more of life's experience
So lead me into caves dark, that we may brighten with our voice.
And lead us into the sunlight where we'll unite with other delights.
