Oh darling, has our love been like an Evergreen tree?
I know the strength I draw from you each day.
Sap to rejuvenate me, make me wild and free,
Dance in glee as I throw all my sadness away.

Oh darling, don't you see I've been dreaming fiercely
Wondering when I'd see you again in this lifetime.
Can we build a bridge to tomorrow, build it speedily?
The one humanity can use before she runs out of time.

Oh darling stand by me, give me your love.
Shine your spirit fiercely as you always do.
I need strength like a bear, flight like a dove.
If I am to kindle a breed of warriors anew.

Oh darling my light is glowing dim, but I wait.
I strove hard to find you, first in my dreams,
Now come quick to me before it's too late.
Do you hear my whimpers amidst their screams?

Oh darling it's good you came when you did.
For together we fought and found a few,
To take our place while this world we rid,
Of goofballs. Now our turn to say adieu!
