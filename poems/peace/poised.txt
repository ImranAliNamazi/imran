Mindset is indeed where the battle needs to be won.
By encouraging us all, you give us a chance to be better.
Perfectionism is a direction to strive for as we dance beneath the sun.
So lead us all, Dear Srini, rally us all with your smile that is our tether.

Your love of sports tells of your showmanship in the game of life.
An engineer in the truest sense, how do you orchestrate the scene?
You mete out your truth, as you use Vivekam, sharp as a knife.
Keep us on our paths with a grimace as we fail to think simple and clean.


Hard work pays off they say, we hope you're happy with the reward.
Or is it the thought of acting without dwelling on the outcome that keeps you motivated?
You balance hardcore tech savvy with empathetic, but that's not odd,
Rather it's endearing, for you always wish us well, help us feel sated.

Where do you stock up on your plutonium, O mighty warrior?
In ages past and places fought did you unleash your chakra?
We'd like to know the secret of what makes you tick as you draw us nearer.
To the goals we dreamt of together as from life we drink sugar or sakra

Remember Dear Srini that soul stuff needs to recycle sometimes...
That the bond of love can never break as we travel the universe.
This bard wishes for you that that poise will carry you the times,
As decades from now we will all remember how well you guided our verse.
