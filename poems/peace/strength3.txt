Friend, I'm sorry I've been seeing the world lopsided
I forgot to ask how you think and feel, how you did
Win each day as you poured your spirits into life.
Courage to face it all, be valiant even through strife.

A well wisher asked me to go out and gain experience
As on this pale blue dot, we struggle to make sense.
It's easy to write for me, but do I see the world clearly?
Tell me my paper children have touched you all dearly!

Friend, how I wish we were all united in our missions
Of spreading good cheer, as we find joy in our grins.
Laughter that gleefully spreads peace and contentment,
A soothing hand that washes away cries of resentment.

Some are vexed by life and suffer in mighty silence.
Some are clueless and, of life can make no sense.
Through it all is an indomitable strength resilient.
As we up the ante and enjoy a life that is well spent.

Friend, I've taken much strength from your abundance.
Time for me to shine forth, shine with loving radiance.
As we all weather the storms that threaten to wreck us.
Then we'll live under clear skies, enjoy life with no fuss.
