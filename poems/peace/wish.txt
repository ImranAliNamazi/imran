Wish you every happiness on this lovely day dear friend,
That your heart soars as you find you're on the mend.
Haven't we been a salve to each other this past year?
Wondering when we'll step into the light, have no fear!

Crazy was I, and so delighted to find someone crazier.
Wish you would continue to delight us with your cheer.
Won't you ease up now, let me know your inmost desire
I would fight like Tulkas, anything to see you smile dear!

Wish we knew our missions on Earth so we could walk
The path we chose, with more confidence, also talk
About these wonderful places so worth seeing by man.
I must seem silly to wish to hold you, share some elan!

Wish for different times, and that we'd strengthen anew
Each other's voice, guffawed into the night as the dew
Evaporated and gave way to a resplendent dawn bright,
Ah dawn, with you beside - how I'dve talked the night!

Wish you a grand time as this poem draws to a close,
That the girls kiss you extra, especially on your nose.
Har har, I even made a funny as I plant one myself.
Goodnight dear, let's see you live, blessed as an Elf!
