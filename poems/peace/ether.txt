The ether is almighty quiet this starry night.
Quiet as when droves of birds leave a forest.
What's the ether telling you my dear delight?
Do we plod on alone or together take rest?

Together can be so much fun if only you'd let go
All the pain that has dullened your senses.
I don't mean to say don't feel, let your heart soar
As it finds healing between this world's fences.

We are bound to this Earth for a while more, so
Let her spirit meld with yours in the depths of time.
I'm afraid to ask for your hand and be told no,
So for now I'm happy to let my love show in rhyme.

It gladdens my heart to know that you exist.
That the ether connects our minds and hearts.
Tell me lover, should I walk through the mist?
Would I find you ready to assemble all my parts?

You see my head and hands are not linked. It's said
That I've been reeling from multiple blows.
And my heart's been on the mend but is afraid.
So will you embrace me, while outside it snows?

A grand couple we'd make, dancing endlessly.
Lover, how I wish you would put your hand in mine.
For then the nights'd seem warmer and blissfully,
I'd know family life as my dad did, a life sublime!
