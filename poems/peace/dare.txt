For a dear old friend, an age after when he used to inspire me.

You love somebody in this world, you better hang on tooth and nail.
Well, we love everyone in this world, even the one's as been to jail.
Is there much goodness out there on this planet I wonder?
Then remember Simon who set out, that exact figure to uncover.

Simon, the day will come when we'll joyfully burst out in song.
For mankind will have survived his adolescence, will finally belong
In the timeless halls of tomorrow, awake to his Mother's pain,
Mother Earth, whom he mistreated, also those from Saudi to Spain.

It's a hard road we tread, but one that will take us everywhere.
As we plant a new seed of kindness, needed like fresh air!
Fight like its the 12th round and you have that devil on the ropes.
Come out swinging for his time is up, we're gonna dash his hopes.

This world's been cruel overlong, its time to find a different beat.
As we learn to dance a new dance, regain mastery of the fleet.
Of sailboats, and rowboats none of which can ever cause evil.
You see, we left off our pettinesses, no longer barter with the devil.

If ignorance is bliss, then cursed is a time of knowing
Unless we fight hard for every inch, for hope keeps us going.
A hope that tomorrow, love with pour forth from everyone's heart.
As we sing joyously, be with the Divine as on life we get a new start.
