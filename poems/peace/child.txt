It's only when we raise children in turn that we come full circle
And know the joy our parents knew when they raised us.
We apply ourselves to the tasks with patience and skill,
As everyday a new miracle they being, with love thus...

Why worry when a golden day keeps dawning and we come closer
To being our true selves - when we have loved, given all we had?
For it's not easy being a parent, sometimes unloved, at times unsure;
Then a friend comes along and brightens us up until we feel glad.

We dream of being the perfect parent, knowing in our hearts that
It's an impossible task, but we unmask the divinity with each day.
We've only to stand in the sun to know precisely where it's at -
The unconditional love we give until a child can find their own way.

A good feeling comes when our families grow to encompass
Our children's teachers, playmates, their families and neighbours.
We dance with joy as we fill the spaces with warmth and surpass
The best we've known, as we discover goodness in many layers.

Dream on dear family as we only want the best for each of you.
The world may be a stage, but play your part to your utmost
For soon, as you discover bounteous pastures, you will bid adieu,
Leaving us tingly with memories accumulated, of which we'll boast.
