A gift from the heavens you are, a stellar gal.
Would you befriend this poor lad, be a pal?
I know you promised many moons ago.
Do you know that to any lengths he'd go

If only there was a chance that you would
Shower your love on him. Had you stood
With him under a waterfall, you'd know...
The depth to which his heart can overflow.

I know you both have left much pain behind
But know that in love, much healing you'd find.
I see you two as a gift unto each other.
Now go make a covenant of love, stay together.

Until death comes and you two will have to part.
When we plumb life to its depths, we know art.
I've told him to be steady and to take it slow.
But be certain that in your heart love can grow.

He's an old Earth soul, seen much pain, much joy.
As a bard, he tells of life as she teases him like a toy.
I don't know if forever you two will be together.
But why not run this course with the other as tether?
