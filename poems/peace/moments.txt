Moments ago I felt a warmth engulf me and then
I looked up to see the shadow of your cape on me.
Oh woman, won't you be a wonder, I know when
You will blossom - soon like an abundant tree!

Moments of my whispered prayers that your heart
Will find life again and voila, it pulses strong and steady.
Now guide my verse as I find a newfound art,
That wants to tell stories of you endlessly.

Moments more of waiting and my heart would drop,
Though for now, it beats noisily and in ecstasy.
Tell me you'd be here this instant and I will stop
All my meandering, rather live with you in glee.

Moments snatched in the course of a busy day,
For we both have much in the labours of this Earth.
Take me as I am, let me guide us along the way.
Ask not much but watch as we plant with mirth,

Seeds that in moments will begin to sprout.
Oh woman, I've dreamt long to be beside you.
Tell me the sad days are on their way out,
That in love we will be bonded like glue.
