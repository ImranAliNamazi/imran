I remember you Kim, with your wonderful room wherein
You created a vibe for us weary travellers to come and chill.
This is going to be so much fun, to watch you turn mother
And bring up another bundle of joy into this world.

This next generation is going to be super special for it's  now
60 years or 3 generations since the flowers bloomed, that
Gave power to the worldwide reforms of the '60s.
Be your best and empower us all to heal with your special

Quality of love that I hope will guide you both in this
Most important undertaking. Children, yay! We love you so.
Give them the power O Magnificent Divine or Cosmic Force
To forge their future which we can witness from the heavens

For someday our race will be run and we'll have chance to reflect
On our deeds or misdeeds - I hope it will be more of the former...
Deeds of valour and exceeding love as we come into our own,
Maybe we'll even have done much for the Earth who is our Mother.

I hope your friends and fans and all those you've touched,
Will pray now for the utmost joy and protection life can give.
For you have been very special to us Kim, an old world force
That soothed our hearts and make us want, in delight to live.
