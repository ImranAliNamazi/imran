I grew up dreaming that lovers ought be entwined
And enmeshed, totally inside each other's heart.
Have I found that sort of love? Believe it I'm inclined.
For this time I've loved you mad, right from the start.

With that smile, you had me at Hello! My love,
What I would do, feeling inspired by your presence.
I may not yet charge hell with a bucket, but I strove
To oust the demons in my head. Now for incense,

As I ask you to sit down beside me as we pray
For happy landings as each sortie would demand.
Forays into enemy territory where is kept at bay
The cowered soul of man, each in agony maddened.

I can imagine you teaching pilots the joy of flight,
Just as we learned it from one love riddled Gull.
Oh love, can we save each soul from their plight?
As I see in the devil's line of warriorsl, a near fatal lull.

Time to stem their tide, find healing for Gods children.
In Yavanna's halls, where walks the River's Daughter.
I know you need silence so I'd leave you in a glen,
While we bring to an end this human slaughter!
