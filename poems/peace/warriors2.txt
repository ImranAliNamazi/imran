A new age is dawning and it needs a new breed of soldiers.
Pacifists at heart with a deep sense of caring for this world.
Who know how to defuse tensions and bring a ray of hope,
Who can fight for truth, condemning the sin not the sinner.

The sinner must know that the sin is an endless journey down an abyss.
And those around him, see to his depths, and find another spirit.
A spirit once mauled and disfigured in the smithies of the Dark Lord.
But which ultimately resonates with the note of this symphony of life.

The time has come to help cleanse each other of the grime
All it needs is 1 single act of caring to stem the tide.
So follow the impulse in your heart dear soldier, extend the olive branch.
And let a new spirit of oneness take hold of this planet.

My words go on, but I hope they hit home for a second,
Dislodging long buried feelings of pains from a sorrowed past.
Who but us, who bear the scars, remember when life was good,
And can set each other free. Free to live with pride, on our terms.

I beg you comrade, friend - we're in the thick of the fight now.
So lay down your club or your mace and find a leaf or a flower.
To extend to the other warrior, for, in the eyes of our Mother, we are one.
Make peace with yourselves now, while there's love beneath the sun!
