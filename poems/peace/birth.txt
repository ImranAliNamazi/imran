Nothing more sublime that the act of birthing and I yearn
To know what a mother feels like as her child begins to learn
The beauty of life for from the moment he utters his first cry
The world is going to run hot and cold, put a tear in his eye

As it reminds him of the depths of emotion in his very being
And he discovers what is meant to forever live in caring.
What higher duty than to be caring to this planet that birthed us
Showed us love in the cycles of life that brings daily bliss.

Dear Kim, love that boy of yours, watch as he learns to walk.
Then play the flute of the Ida, Pingala and Sushumna and talk
To us in tongues foreign which spring from the Divine Fountain.
The fountain within which brings us our daily baptism like rain.

I wonder what cosmic forces are about to incarnate here.
For you've lived a devoted life full of love and good cheer.
You must have sought the divine grace in asking for a baby fair.
Who will delight us all, seem like a starlit rainbow in fresh air.

Go now, hug that little bundle of joy and break into song.
For he will be joining us in this cosmic scene before too long.
Think of the Daivic Forces that wove the necklace of the stars
Then pick up a flute and play for that little boy a few bars.
