Fleeting were the days of my youth, but bare
They were, for a woman's love I wouldn't dare
Ask, for I was shy and unsure of the way to go.
Now I beg you take me to a time long, long ago.

When Elvensight told me of the way to tread.
Dough in the Lord's kiln, e'er turning to bread.
Come hold me in your arms for just another day
I promise to love you back, let our bodies sway

As we feel a joyous life coursing in our veins.
Lead on my love, it's you I let hold the reins.
Fleeting was my first vision of your soft beauty.
But the years have shown what you mean to me.

Face to face, heart to heart, body to body...
You've tamed my wild heart, Now let's go whee
As we go up and down on the merry-go-round.
I feel replete as I dance for this love, now found.

I bask in the dew on a starlit night and gaze
Into eternity in your stirring eyes, in a daze,
For its your face I would remember all my life.
Let me now ask that we live as man and wife.
