Akka, to me you've been more than just a patch of blue,
That smile I remember lighting up my days - thank you!
I wish you now, that as another year begins, the very best
As you wrestle with life, as she puts you to the test...

When cloudy days came you would just talk and show me,
What stellar stuff we're made of, and I'd sway and go whee :)
Will you tell us the secret of your inner strength, the well
You draw resplendence from? Come, we beg you to tell.

I hope that work goes inspired, interesting and in service,
Of the people you've worked for these many years O wise.
Now go out and have some fun, as this bard wishes you would.
Tell me when you last felt elated, as every lover of humanity should!

We should never feel gloomy long and it's glee when clouds clear.
As friend, I've always felt the peace that radiates from you my dear!
What have these two score years taught you, I pray do tell.
Weave your magic wand and with love, around us cast a spell.

I go now wondering at the strength and bubbliness that is you...
You've meant a lot in my life as I'm sure you've helped redeem a few.
Let another year pass and we will have spent a dozen well.
Now go drink from the cup of life, and let jangle your bell!
