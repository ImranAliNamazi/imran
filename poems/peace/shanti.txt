13 days ago, another river of time has come to an abrupt end
And in searching for the meaning of it all, much time we spend.
It's part of the natural process for soul stuff to recycle too.
But without lament, to send off a dear departed, we seldom do.

Ultimately its attachment that weighs on a body when it's time to go
So free your minds my loving family, let your dear father go.
It takes time for the upheavals of feelings to truly subside,
For peace to overcome and for the free flowing of the tide.

"Make me a channel of Godly love and endearing peace.
Where there was injury your pardon. We pray for ease.
Where the heart is disturbed let a stream of love abide
Remember, that as family, we will always be at your side"

Now think of the events that have shaped your lives
And let the knots unclench as now more time flies
For soon we each have to face our own mortality,
So wipe away the angst and regret, sing sweetly.

For life is a hymn in praise of that Heavenly Lord
Who gives us a flavour of things, begs us to find accord.
As we do when we are not weary of the journey
So devote our lives to him, and spend time wisely.
