Prosperity is wanted by all, but few of us become the
Doer for reward is only given to those who can show
Prowess and skill in their chosen profession. Show
Equanimity and poise in all things for then will reign

Peace, the most sought after commodity on Earth.
Humane acts start with ourselves then we will have
Woke from our stupor and with courage, we can
Resolve to build a better world for all especially sundry.

Focused on this so called sundry, we surrender the ego.
Accountable we are for not conquering prejudice, for as
Earth's steward we must be magnificent and give back.
Abundance can be ours if only we let fly our imagination.

Integrity is certainly important, along with courage.
Consciousness must steadily and rapidly improve in
Seamless growth as we regain and develop a
Child's innocence and fascination for all that is.

Tomorrow tarries not with yesterday but we remember
Those gone who inspire a new verse in our hearts.
Joyous can be the times if only we let go our fears
And cling tightly to that universal message of love.
