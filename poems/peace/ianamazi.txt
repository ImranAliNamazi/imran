I remember well the time I, Imran Ali Namazi got online
It was the year 1999 and Hotmail was in fashion
Little did I know that in 20 years I'd have Amadeus sublime
And later, a girl with whom to ride any tide - our mission,

To be the best selves we can be, and love all humanity
As friends do sometimes, kindred spirits who move mountains.
We've only just begun, and hold dearly to our own sanity,
Let me now go back in time, thinking of thunderclouds and fountains.

By college's end I had a few buddies who are out here tonight
We've been down in the valley, and over the mountain and love
Each so dearly, we've even stood by the other, facing our plight.
Life may get blurry, but friends warm you like a bonfire on a windy cove.

I maintain that life's ups and downs come to teach us of strength
And compassion. Fast forward to the 2010s, and I became
An adept, swimming the spiritual seas to its width and length.
I brag not anymore for there's a divinity in us all, for we're the same

ie Dust in the Wind as the band Kansas would have us know.
In 2015 I met a girl and the words just tumbled out of me.
I've now 400 poems to my name, and love you all as a fire aglow.
For touching me with your stories that fill us with sadness or glee.
