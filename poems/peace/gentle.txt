Gentle and warm was the feeling in my heart
When we met. Now we live alone and far apart.
Take my arm dear, show me the way to you
And sing for me, so I'll never have to feel blue.

Gentle was the song of birds as the breeze caught
Their melody. A plot in your heart I hope I've got.
For there's nowhere else on Earth I would rather be,
Than holding you tenderly. So let's love and be merry.

Gentle was your gaze as you looked to see this boy.
I swear that with your hand, I'd know sheer joy.
I'm wondering if you'd guide me to my prime.
If our love would consummate, a thing sublime.

Gently I'd take you, a night to remember and cherish.
A night to dream upon the stars and to make a wish.
That you would be with me for as long as life lasts.
Before we go back to God, relive other pasts.

Gently I beg you to consider this overgrown fool.
Who'd give a lot to have you, his source of cool.
My love, I'd be thrilled if only you would think
To have me, for life is fleeting, gone in a blink!
