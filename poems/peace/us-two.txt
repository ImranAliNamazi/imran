I remember the days when we would lay on the grass, our bodies one;
Our souls commingling as the hours went past, until the coming dawn.
Oh Pat, don't you remember telling me we'd lay like that now and forever?
How your hair against my face would make my knees weak, send a shiver

Down my spine as I clasped your hand to my bosom. How we rose and fell
As our exertions left us in our own bubble, where we built a haven from hell
As we looked and found deep in our hearts - that true love could never fade.
Now I look at the pictures you left and wonder if we'd meet again in that glade.

Aaah, the memories leave me short of breath, clutching my heart.
Do come to live at my side, for then, life would again have art.
I miss you terribly, wish things weren't so strained between us,
If I gifted you a garden of plants, would you return to me without fuss?

I wonder dear how life has treated you these five and score years.
The memories are thick, I remember the good amidst the tears.
But I promised myself I wouldn't cry to myself all night long,
Oh Pat don't you realize that it's beside you where I belong.

I walk down a long corridor of heartache and disappointment.
It's hard to hold your head high, when every turn robs you of a sentiment.
Come back, oh dear, what I'd give to have you to cherish and hold,
With you by my side, I'd be again daring, courageous and bold!
