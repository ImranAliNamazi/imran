I keep wondering when this movement, founded in love will reach critical mass
Our numbers keep growing, as we learn to love and improve our own nature.
We oust corrupt politicians here and there, undo decades of damage to us.
I'm sorry, but sub-human will simply not do it any more - love every last creature!

For it's a most beautiful world we live in, where we are asked to "stand to center".
Remember the love our prophets bore us, stand tall and valiant in any theater.
Our friends in Sri Lanka stood very tall today for they have roused themselves.
Rid themselves of another leech, a pesky nuisance who'd deny them bread loaves.

You see their economy has come crashing down these past months, no fuel or food.
I know not why, for they were once  the "Granary of Asia", had a happy brotherhood.
Before this new devastation began, I spoke to a friend who wanted to start
A radio show that reminded his people of their rich cultural heritage and art.

I've come to realize that the best life begins when we unite as a world.
For then we will love all peoples who make this Earth, not be twirled
And manipulated by myopic "leaders" who only lead us into disaster.
Not knowing the consequences they'll have to face in the hereafter.

For nothing is worse that to lead when you have not the heart.
To lead with integrity and principles, ah that is the very art
We need a new breed of visionaries, healers and educators.
We've vexed Mother Earth overlong, time to show our splendours.
