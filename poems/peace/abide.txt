A partner must always be very involved in your growth
I wish you know each other well, be your best, you both!
They say life's full of ups and downs, it's how we ride
The bumpy bits, as in each other's arms we abide.

All marriages they say are a covenant made with God
And yet many take it lightly - I find that rather odd.
I've always found that life partners bring out the best
In each other, as life puts your wit and grit to the test.

Dance on dears, it's time to fill your cup to overflow
Even though life is sometimes gonna bring a low.
Take the good with the bad, there's no other way
Than to embrace the moments, as dreams hold sway.

I hope that one day someday you will come to learn
That together was better, as a prize you have won.
For those who run the course are delighted to find,
That it's best with someone to share your mind.

<strong>Dream on dear couple, let this special day be yours,
As you think back at this important step in the years
Ahead, and realize that life can be really very sweet,
When two hearts meet and always together will beat!</strong>
