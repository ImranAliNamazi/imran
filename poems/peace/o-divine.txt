O Divine, help us to serve on green pastures where
Our fellow beings could dance with nary a care.
Lead us not into temptation and deliver us from the vile
For since we began to plunder, it's been a while.

O Divine, your plans are nearly full circle and we'd like
To help you manifest a higher power, so do strike
Down the wicked and petty that in their hearts may be,
Warriors such as me and my friends, who pray to Thee.

O Divine, won't you hear this lovable woman who does
But ask for clemency, a definite stoppage of her woes.
Her spirit is fierce, she has been faithful to your designs
But now could do with some gentleness as she mines

Earth, O Divine, looking for gold in the human breast.
She's clear she will hold your hand until she can rest.
I say to you both, I'll bring all of my forces to bear.
To serve you as you teach our children to care.

Oh Divine, fill all our hearts with your frightful song,
For we run amok thinking this Earth to us does belong.
In your despite we play with fire, not having the sense
That your dreams can take us to the very heavens!
