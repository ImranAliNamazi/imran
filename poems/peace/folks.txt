I tell you folks, you mean something special to me.
I can now love again, use my voice to shout in glee.
Love myself, first and foremost as I break the shackle
That held me back - my mind now beginning to tinkle

And sparkle as it comes back to loving, livable life.
Steel to replace the treacle inside as I blow the fife.
We've all a unique instrument to play and a wand
That keeps the demons at bay if only we'd bend

With the ins and outs of life instead of being brittle.
Love her madly, do - let your life show the mettle
With which every one of is gifted by the Divine,
A grace which braces us, helps find a life sublime.

Watching as we live our lives in darkness or joy
Is the shepherd who we think treats us as a toy.
But loved we are by all of this wonderful cosmos
The fragrance of this universe does guide our verse.

What can I say now friends except that I look forward
To the times we will meet, tunes that will lead us toward
A resplendent tomorrow where each of us will be
Excellent to one another, for then, beauty we will see.
