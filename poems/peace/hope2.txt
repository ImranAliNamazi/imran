I can love you so deep that you renew hope,
To have someone to protect and care for you.
I told myself long ago I'd cease to mope
When I found a girl who stopped me feeling blue.

Hope you find me tender and loving my dear.
That each lovely day brings new joys untold.
Help me plot a course for us and then steer
This riverboat, for then, our dreams'd unfold.

Hope your senses reel at the thought of me.
And all the ways I'd touch you deep and wild.
How I'd bask in your love, shout in pure glee,
As we found ways to unmask the inner child.

Hope you take heart at these 10 poems I've penned.
Filled as I was with the wonder of a newborn fawn.
Darling it's beside you I always belong, so do send,
A cloud upon which to ride, to meet you at dawn.

Hope our love can weather any storm - don't let go.
Meet me soon as you can let go your moorings.
I'd love to watch the sun appear, don't say no.
It'd be a splendid morn for oft dreamed of things.
