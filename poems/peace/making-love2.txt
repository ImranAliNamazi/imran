Oh love, I am loving fiercely for the third time in my life.
I think of my entire life - your absence cuts like a knife.
The race to win my heart is on, not sure you'll make it,
You see someone I know is holding it, her love starlit!

Or should I give up loving completely, stay dullened
To the simple beauty of walking beside a girl to the end!
I don't know why you women make me feel so jumbled.
In wondering who, when and how, I am mighty troubled.

Oh love, won't you come quick? I feel very desolate.
Come make love to me before I find another mate!
I've been waiting for you to grace my life since forever.
I keep pouring my love on sillies who, pass they'd rather.

Or do I resign myself to a life of crying alone in solitude?
Know that if you came now, we'd have in magnitude,
A life comparable to no other - and love never bleak,
For we would daily weave it into a tapestry unique.

Oh love, I tire now and think I may instead very soon
Take a lover to bed, climax and have her in a swoon,
For the years lengthen and my body feels weary.
Without you I'd perish, my mind become all dreary.
