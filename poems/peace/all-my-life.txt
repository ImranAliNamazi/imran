This line rings true... All of my life, I've been searching for a girl
To love me, like I love you. So step in and set my heart awhirl.
All my life I dreamt of having someone understand the meaning
Of this love in my heart - a love the dancer in me can bring

To the fore as we dance to the fragrance of the cosmic scene.
Wondering at the gifts our creator left for us to find and bring
To humanity and loved ones, gifts of utter soul touching tenderness.
So dance on dear, weave the magick of love around my every sense.

All my life I kept whittling away at the kernel of my being and at my heart.
Now I find a wonder there, a boy enthralled at your sweet art.
Take me as I am, woman make me shout aloud in joy and gasp for air,
As I step up to hold you aloft, shine your light bright into the sky there.

All my life I wanted to find a girl like Stormy, who like me would want,
To delight the world's children, and with our combined voices, enchant.
As we show them the joy that is boundless flight, I wonder at Baxter
Thinking we'd house the body of Richard incarnate - ready girl?

To abide in my arms for all of our lives, unto the depths of eternity.
If so, then just call to say you love me, love me so very splendidly!
10 years ago, I caught a wisp of you in a dream and clung on,
Now your turn to enter in my life, be like a splendid sun.
