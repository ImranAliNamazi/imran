Dance, to the movement of the stars. Sing
And know the depths to which love would bring
You, a day amazed when your lips would gorge
Upon each other. So fashion love in your forge.

Dance and let the sun guide your bouncy steps.
Tell him to catch up, plumb you to your depths.
Take him to bed and watch as he delights in you.
Sings every verse to keep you from being blue.

Dance and watch him spring on verdant meadows.
Know he gave up the world with it's murky shadows.
To be at your side, a decision he'd not regret,
As you play a chord, your fingers beside a fret.

Dance and be merry as the river woman's daughter.
For with that lithe old fellow, you'd spread cheer.
I find him a dear, as you will in time know of him,
That he's a joy to have, through thick and thin.

Dance you two, weave the story of the world between
The tapestry of your own world. With senses keen,
You two can do much to heal her of her pain
Only a few can help her, her buoyancy to regain.
