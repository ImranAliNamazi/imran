With you by my side, I'd be again daring, courageous and bold!
Dear Pat, come back, make happy again this fool whose growing old.
Bereft and lost have I been with unsure step and mirthless laugh.
Come quickly and let's ride on a magic carpet, bring back my staff.

The one I used as wizards do to take us places full of Faery.
Where the stars would twinkle and stop us from feeling dreary.
Pat, I remember crystal clear the expression on your face
How sweetly you'd share mine dreams, ah your charm and grace.

That smile that would turn my night into day that first drew me
To you, as we held hands and I would kiss you, laughing with glee.
Frigid you seem now, oh darling don't you remember the day
We fought as one, for our children whose dreams ought hold sway?

I lie in bed but it's cold and hard and so much I miss you
Did we have to part? Is it 10 years since you said adieu?
Kissing fierce I remember, the warmth of your skin...
How I'd love to have you and to hold, how I'd grin

With delectable mischief and bad intent in my eye,
As I think of those nights when there was no you or I.
Only a warmth emanating from the bundle that was us.
Come here my love, my heart, let's have no more fuss!
