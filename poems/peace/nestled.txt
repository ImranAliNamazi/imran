He had grown up nestled in an idyllic family that did give
Him their utmost attention, but now, the real world does bombard
Him with its ruthless readings of his intentions and actions.
He misses the days when adults would give him his due.

There's many eccentricities at play in his life and he has no time.
To analyze them all, rather take his talent and hit the road.
For its in the joy of creating stories that he feels the most liberated.
It boggles one to think of all the thoughts that swirl in his mind.

He rarely follows through with his intentions that remain often,
Half a page of scribbled lines on a subject outside his domain.
In the art of programming he's finding it harder to keep up,
With a world of results and no interest in those who've honed the craft.

He's been a wretch until late when he's grown to count his blessings.
But still the voices in his head are so godawful loud and raucous.
He dreams of making a difference but is trapped in the rat race.
Deems himself an artist but knows only Niggle's crankiness.

Defunct and disappointed, he wonders how to end the madness
Rather drink crystal clear water as a gift from a Princess.
He's done with the old life, it's time to plan and be more effective,
As friends tell him he's worthy of being counted with the rest.
