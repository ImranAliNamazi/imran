There's a place in your heart that could open again.
If only you'd let me in, hear your beauty in my refrain!
Love me tender, love me soon, love me from on high.
Tell me you'll hold me for some time, ask not why.

My heart is overflowing with the wine of the ages.
This songbird's heart will beat, know no more cages!
Lead me on, to the light, let go the pain and hurt.
Dear, love me till eternity, be not distant or curt.

Why not have each other for who knows what remains,
Of water in the cup of life, let's sing loudly our refrains.
Time wears on, I wait for you to jump-start my heart,
That feels bereft of your love, waits for itself to start,

As you touch my hand and let our love light up
The skies as sparks fly from our skin, a deep cup
To drink from as I moisten your skin with my kisses,
And you fire up my imagination with far of places.

Places I would take you if only you gave me your hand
And agreed to be led under mountains and on sand.
Save all your kisses for me love, let me have you beside,
As we ride The storms of love, in both high and low tide.
