What I'd give to melt in your arms tonight
As we make love under the stars so bright.
To be a brook that runs swiftly under your feet.
To be a lamb in your hands, that gently does bleat.

Melt at my touch my love, for I have tender hands.
Make love to me, in glades and on beach's sands.
I've waited eternity to get to know you well.
Now hold me to you, under your soulful spell.

Melt me down to my elements, then cast me anew.
For I would be pliant for you. My pledge I'd renew,
To hold and cherish you until the end of my days.
To swirl in your waters, live enthralled by your gaze.

Melt at my words dearest one, I've woven them special.
I've walked the Earth, but never seen such a gal.
Loveable and pure as the driven snow.
Come to me now, set my heart all aglow.

Melt we do daily under each other's steely fire.
A gaze that would betray our fiercest desire.
Take me woman, hold me to you and be steady,
As I conjure dreams, to keep us truly, madly, deeply.
