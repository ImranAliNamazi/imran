Once we flush the toxins from our mind, we realize
The world view that was jaded was actually us,
Who see limitations, for we know not to internalize
And reconcile conflicts, rather we fume and fuss.

Not to say everything's alright, not even Jesus could
Turn the world from looking at things upside down.
Perhaps that Armageddon needs kindling and wood,
And begins the day we wake and start to disown -

This or other stupid petty ignoramus from wrecking
Our dreams and trampling our ideals. Be serene
And know that the Ocean of Life, is indeed smiling
On our little isle of blessedness. Become clean

With each passing day as the maladies are cleansed
From our collective consciousness. Offer hope
Like a salve to those who need it. But mended fully
Is he who can offer forgiveness, not dangling rope

To he who he wanted strung for all the atrocities
Done, which can only be undone with love. Thus spake
This unknown bard, for with elvensight he sees,
Clarinet players that leave aught but gold in their wake.
