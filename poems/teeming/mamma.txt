Mamma you have taught me well - how to live happy
Mamma your touch calms me and turns me to love
Mamma tell me your troubles - I'll kiss them away gladly
Mamma remember how hard your parents strove

Mamma will there come a day when you toil no more
Mamma how I would like to grow up and care for you
Mamma what dreams I latch onto with your sweet lore
Mamma when I grow up, will I be as beautiful as you

Mamma what of roses on the way to the Garden of Eden
Mamma tell me quick why is this world such a mess
Mamma I know your tired, just hold on until when...
I'm strong Mamma, and can soothe away your stress

Mamma dont worry now we shall be kept in God's grace
Mamma I know its tough but take courage from within
Mamma, sweet mamma, how the lines adorn your face
Mamma, I love you above all - through both thick and thin

Mamma I may have been hard to bring up but I'm told
That mamma, kids do that in their folly, but grow tall
Mamma your love keeps our lamp from growing cold
Mamma be at peace now, for I hear the Divine's call
