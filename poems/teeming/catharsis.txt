There's many times in life we trample our own emotions
We're not used to giving them time to heal and go away
An early one is when our innocence is lost, no notions
That life is joysome always, our dreams here to stay

Then we begin work and wonder how to reach the top
Selling our principles short somewhere in the mad rush
Up the corporate ladder, we never think to pause or stop
We jam our feelings, making them silenced and hush

We meet a partner not having explored our own selves
So we're not sure what we need nor what we can offer
The pressure to procreate makes us forget ourselves
So we build a strained family with everyone grosser

<strong>We lose a parent and the jammed feelings go deeper
Cause we've been taught never to give into raw grief
So many years of stifled emotions, pathways steeper
What will trigger a catharsis, dewdrops on a leaf?</strong>

Yes nature can suddenly bring pent emotions to the fore
We acknowledge and release all our causes of despair
A walk in the woods with a friend who asks for more
Churning emotions, we heal when our heart we bare
