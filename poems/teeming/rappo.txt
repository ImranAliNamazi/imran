You see, I grew up with dreams broken and shattered
Dad was poor - financially where it really mattered
Then came Rappo who, with concern gave us a leg up
Provided our basics so I could learn without hiccup

I went on to college and studied social work
For the rich didn't support the poor - what a quirk
The Lord had ordained we care for our community
But few of us did - to genuinely set someone free

I met Rappo again as adult, to help the others
From my catchment, for they'd lit the embers
Making us feel glad to be together again
So we could joyfully augment this Earth's refrain

They're a little different, they're not an aggregator
Being unfair to the small man, rather they tailor
Their platform to strengthen the small businesses
Along with its hyperlocal community that witnesses

A digital transformation so they make from the haves
And spend gratuitously to enhance first with loaves
Then with baking skills until every life they touch
Can stand, so stand by them Lord, give them much
