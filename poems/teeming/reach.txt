If I could reach the stars, I'd pull em all down and make
Your dreams come true, give water so thirst you'd slake
I cannot do it all myself, that's why I strive for change
In the very fabric of society, people think us strange

For wanting each member of humanity to ante up
And live for another person, help overflow their cup
I'd give food to you if I could but I'd rather ask your
Brother to prepare some for you, be your succour

But how do I make him when he does not feel your pain
You see, he's drowning in a stew, can't begin again
And try to fill his life with meaning and consideration
This indifference is mighty hard, leads to damnation

We have come to a standoff, which my friends dread
One of them writes so well but its all fluff in his head
One serves willingly but does it seeking to go to heaven
How to create a movement that flies quick as a raven

I can keep planting seeds of brotherly caring and giving
But it falls on deaf ears, of those who seem happy living
Fully for themselves, how can they be so disdainful
Dont they cry at another's grief, one that's so painful!
