I plant my feet gladly in the middle of a jungle safari
Look at the birds chirping from the top of a tree
The Sun beats down from above, warm splendour
And mamma serves subji with rotis made of flour

I see a distant cloud that takes the shape of a bear
Reminds me of a stuffed toy I love, I breathe the air
And smell the sea splashing on the rocks nearby
You are my friend, dear Bear, let's touch the sky

In our dreams as we float afar on silvery wings
Mangoes which I love come into my singings
Planting them was a memory I have with father
And the birds around would soar ever higher

Sun, dear sun, how life thrives under your carpet
Mamma, you turned me to nature and now im set
On learning biology and geology, plot every cloud
As I see to far horizons thinking of love out loud

Love for rocks and rills, woods and templed hills
You see, being with nature causes me juicy thrills
We took a long time waking up from our stupidity
Now let's plant mangoes and show love until eternity
