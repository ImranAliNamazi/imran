We always count our losses on the road for they cut deep
Take us to a past before we were broken, make us weep
The pain is so raw, we feel it poignantly as a rapier sword
Remember the good and times of bliss, word for word

I've seen little of life but I've seen grief second handed
I've seen it kill a father to think of his son's life ended
I've seen it kill a wife as her children were still studying
Am proud of those girls, like their mother now teaching

My friend had a 4 year old daughter when upside down
Went life, a remarriage brought trouble causing a frown
But now she's happy, though we dont talk like before
Another's pained but still spreads joy from shore to shore

So much anger and violence end in harsh separation
Why do we say "I do" and then hit or claim domination
I really pray for you all to find peace at end of day
Some dont get along or refuse to walk along the way

Now you, I understand want to taste life to its dregs
So scream and cry and brood, why even kick your legs
Know that in the end you'll find the way back to God
Upbraid him for neglecting you, I do not think that odd
