I write to impress, I wannabe famous, I wanna feel love
That's why I in the first place began to strive so hard
I don't observe a spear of grass or look to heaven above
I lose my way often i jump from effort to effort - sad

It is that our ego is filled with vain becomings and titles
Emptying the mind is the hardest thing to do. It's filled
With people rich in spirit but humble in their castles
It's like I forgotten who I am, my owm story missed

I imagine myself doing this or that great feat while I
Actually am in a coma dreaming silly dreams
And when I touch my real self I recoil, for he is crass
And inconsistent between his thought, word and deed

Run on Empty folks, the time is near, when all we need
Are the unfettered mind and a fierce valiant spirit
I leave you now to find your own inner self
As I dig deep to rediscover a boy who was lost

He was last seen causing his family to laugh in glee
For that end he ever would strive now and be free
Im his mind, his enthusiasm infectious as a bee
Buzzjmg around trying to cross pollinate ideas
