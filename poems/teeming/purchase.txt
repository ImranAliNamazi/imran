I detect a tremor of sorrow when you say kurai ondrum illai
Not complaining doesn't always mean having your way with joy
I wish life weren't so hard on the good of heart, I do pray that
Healing will come, that, the life divine is an established fact

Now I realize I've always been stifled by people's mindsets
As a girl, I'm sure the world is harsher, kanna let go your regrets
And give your soul purchase to dream of the stars and beyond
Please take a refreshing dip in a rushing river or an icy pond

Wash away all the grime from people with stunted character
Hold on to your dreams and go boldly painting your picture
That vision of tomorrow that's so vivid and real in your mind
Just always remember to love yourself, be especially kind

For you hold the secret of life and a better tomorrow in you
Grace us with your laugh, gently soothe us, keep us from being blue
Our generation is on the brink of a profound and great discovery
Many of us know it as a conviction, it makes us leonine and fiery

Now we dwell on the lord that holds the stars in the palm of his hand
We're ready to fight for his peace and love to prevail, make a stand
I only wish more of our friends would feel liberated and free
As we grasp the essence of life, learning to live it most merrily
