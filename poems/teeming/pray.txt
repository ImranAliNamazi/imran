There's so much healing needed in all our lives
We forget to repose in the lap of our creator
Have the confidence that He knows our inmost heart
We pray Lord for patience in watching your plan unfold

There were so many themes raging about Eru's throne
Yet the simple ones gathered power and profundity
Make my humble offerings worthy Lord, guide me
As I pray to You for direction and force of strength

I forgot the wonder of looking to each day for your grace
I was mesmerized by all the glitter and the drabby colours
Made my mood somber until all I saw was rueful blue
But now I pray Lord, let me feel your peace and your glory

I've said before we're so caught up in our own tale
We fail to see the pain of a loved one, let alone a stranger
You who wove the necklace of the stars - now fashion
A bountiful life as I pray to find healing under your bosom

<strong>I beseech you Lord to free me from all limitation
Let me be as Thorondor himself, soaring on high
My time will come, until then I patiently prepare
And pray that my time in the melee will be to your liking</strong>
