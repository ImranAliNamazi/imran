A Saint asked us to let go of all our lower tendencies
And Invite the Divine to guide us and fill our hearts
With Grace. His line has teachers as give us a lease
On life that's fresh and sparkling. Unerring as darts

Their nuggets of wisdom fly and cleave the dark knot
That binds us to our inconscient past, full of hate
Bogged down by the years, many of us know not
The way forward, progress leaves a bitter taste

For we're not going forward but back, deny the light
When instead we need to embrace change and LIVE
Who am I to speak of darkness, one who has no might
Or force of love to will you to let go and yourself forgive

Let's get moving, let's illuminate each others lives at will
From dawn to dusk and dusk to dawn as we could
Fill our cup with Divine Grace and pour until it doth spill
Into our loved ones cups, and we, for our children stood

For they embrace much more easily the golden drops
Of wisdom from our saints and seers who taught
With love. How to win the day? Aspiration in dollops
Peace and Generosity too else all will come to aught
