[Poet]

I really respect the friend who says he simply will not be licked
Breaking down and giving up is a sore place for those kicked
Down by life, who cannot pull out that inner resolve and see
They get back on their feet again, get back up most quickly

[Needs Compassion]

I'm jaded and dont really know when the befuddlement began
I think back to my youth when I was a strapping young man
Who laughed at the thought of ever being chained inside
Now I'm embarrassed at what I've become, cannot hide

From my probing self that would dig to the root of the matter
I drink keeping him from knowing the joys sobriety can offer
It's a vicious cycle that beats me down until I am numbed by it all
I've forgotten the days when daddy would stand with me so tall

I keep burning bridges with my inability to face my truth
That I need to accept myself as broken once since youth
The guilt of giving up wears constantly at my core until
I wish all day long that my beating heart would be still

[Poet]

Would that I could iron out the discord and sadness in you
Keep you my brother from crying and constantly feeling blue
Have faith the game is not over yet my friend would gently say
And beg that deep within - your heart courageously holds sway
