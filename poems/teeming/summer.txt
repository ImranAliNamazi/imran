Nothing like enjoying a brief summer's day
When we lift our kids and dance and sway
Rejoicing in the moment, knowing they're there
To give us determination for a tomorrow of care

We're done with the old ways, a seed planted
By this virus, treasuring the ideas we started
I dunno you much but think we're similar
In wanting our children to love, not suffer

The ways of the Lord seem mysterious at times
But with faith and toil, improve will the climes
Remember our time is short, so spend it well
Let our children dance in the light, weave a spell

Dance with joy to accentuate the lows they may feel
Life is a roller coaster, fun for a while but always real
The spell weaves on, taking them to higher pastures
Something they can relate to, feel like their own masters

What are these treasures to cherish, ideas that doth make
Their life a joy to behold, helping them their thirsts to slake
Let ours and their purposes unite as they feel strongly
For the co-inhabitants of this earth - a bond growing deeply
