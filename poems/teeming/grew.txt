I grew up listening to tunes that took me to the top
Now sometimes I wonder will the music ever stop
Then I realise the music is all around engulfing us
And wonder why there's hate, why do people fuss

I grew up with books and travelled to lands afar
The spirit of things tell me we need not be at war
What use the power of the unsheathed plume
When countries war and burn, rape and fume

I grew up in wonderland, watching bunnies hop
Wagon trains of horses would go by clippety clop
Then time came and we realized it's not all daisies
Some horrible things keep being done by crazies

I grew up with 2 uncles who are close to me
Then came these buddies before me who I see
Our butterflies are broke but our ship is all thats left
And music is her name, so never let time commit theft

I grew up thinking time on us would ever prey
But we've a good 84,000 seconds to live each day
What good amidst this o me, o life I wonder
Then look in the mirror, touched by my splendour
