Now I've had a glimpse of the joy you and other teachers face
How it feels to tell children stories, take them to a far off place
I dunno how you parents survive without rest, without refuge
Inflation and a lack of good company leave a strain quite huge

Dear girl, I sensed a soft resilience about you the day we met
I implore you to follow your dream, don't stop until you get
To where you wanna go in life for yourself and your little girl
There's dreamcatchers to touch and let them give you a whirl

Maybe our paths will lead us to new places where we can strive
I wanna serve, and think that's what makes you too feel alive
So lets talk and see if we can form a special PACT where
Parents and Teachers alike can help each other get there

Where? We'll arrive at when we meet and allay each other's fears
Help our kids develop their talents, smoothly change their gears
My dearest two teachers still care for me so very tenderly
We treat this wonder called life as a blessing, and are free

To walk the path we chose as we want all new generations to do
I wonder in my deepest heart if this prayer will reach a few
And perhaps change their lives into a constant source of joy
I wonder what ImPACT Imu can make, for he's such a dear boy
