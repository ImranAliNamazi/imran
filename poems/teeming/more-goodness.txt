I know now beauty to be highly subjective
A pure soul recognize goodness in another
Now you've turned 40, how do you live?
Have you good friends to bring you to cheer?

I hope that fount of goodness is ever spreading
In these mad times that vex our pale blue dot
Would courageous people like you be out leading
Or like me sit aghast at the horror of our lot

We've come the halfway mark in life I know
But did we do wrong - what would we change
What's the point of it all? How do we glow
In the warmth from the heavens, it's strange

To see 7 billion people straining upto tear
When we need more goodness from those
Like you who were born to run - like a hare
Run ahead and liberate us from our woes

Now I understand why they say be unique
For there is a certain beauty in our diversity
Im a stupid sentimental fellow, perhaps weak
But you just spread goodness with ferocity!
