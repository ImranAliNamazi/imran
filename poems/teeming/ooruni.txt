Ooruni is an initiative for organic farming
Samu and Swami are it's founders - they bring
A lot of passion and dedication, directing it all
They soon hope to, like Akshaya Patra, stand tall

And serve as many of God's children as they can
There's a certain serenity about the place, oh man
I tell you the farm has an old world and rustic charm
That was Anusha's outing, I too visited a simple farm

These first generation farmers are a new breed
It's a pleasure to watch such grounded people feed
The animals around them, wildlife and visitors too
A pity that forerunners as they, there are such few

We can join their movement and create an awareness
About organic farming, you simply cannot guess
The benefits to humankind, the techniques they use
An age old wisdom - so sustainable are their views

She had tasty food prepared over a wood fire
I look forward to the day they will be an empire
For goodness needs to be magnified manifold as we
Spend more memorable days with team Ooruni
