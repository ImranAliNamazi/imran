You see I know nothing of worrying for I'm not a parent
But I do see friends struggling with kids for that moment
And frustrated that parenting is often not rewarded in word
Thank your dad for putting food on the table? How absurd!

The amount of grief parents go through when siblings fight
Is enough for them to lose their conviction and divine insight
That the most rewarding feeling is knowing you gave your best
Even when kids mewl or are gruff, you're just being put to the test

When toddlers, we worry about our children developing fine motor skills
And not falling sick or having accidents and being hurt - what chills
Run down our spine when we fear the worst may befall unto them
We miss out on watching their story unfold - grow firmly their stem

And as they study and their thoughts branch out, we worry for exams
And jobs, not realizing those are unimportant things - a trifle it seems
In the grand designs of our Lord - actually they are tested on character
Will they care for a sickly neighbour or buy a homeless man a sweater?

They will if we gave them a deep enough soil in which to bury their roots
And not let them grapple with superficialities like brooches and boots
Don't worry dear parents, all things are covered in the grand circle of life
Plant your fields and soon their turn will come to know worry and strife
