My roots have been shaken, my emotional growth stunted
Each loss on the road has left me feeling sombre and daunted
I've searched high and low for a woman to love till eternity
Perhaps in wrong places, now time to discover what is serenity

It's a state of being where having and not having do not sadden
A temper of spirit, full of a gladness to which one does hearken
I shake off the hazy past and the wounds where I've bled
Looking instead for some angel to appear so I can be led

Into a joyous tomorrow, oh one where my shoots grow fast
In the sunlit path where there's no darkness from any old past
Instead a kind of hush appears all over the world, we see
Lovers walking hand in hand, their flighty selves set free

I guess God put a smile upon her face, oh what that smile does
Sets my heart into thrills at each word and gesture of hers
I dunno if she will be found on this mortal plane or is lifted
Beyond the rainbows of this life, would I meet her and be gifted

Perhaps that's the thrill of life - watching each moment unfold
Expectantly, knowing there's no bounds to divine grace I'm told
My shoots quiver at the thought of dancing in the light
Soulful dancing as only a twin-flame can make me so bright
