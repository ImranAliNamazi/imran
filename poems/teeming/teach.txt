Hey teach, was it just yesterday you taught us digestion
With a foreshadowing either of us'da had a premonition
That we'd be thick as thieves in the days to come
When I'd earn my own wings you'd never have known

But that's what I set out to do in the years before us
You can call me a late bloomer, but it's what I'd like
To receive some of that love we all had for you
As a teacher standing apart, coaxing out the best in us

I'm sorry I've said many silly things over the years
Gurgled nonsense in my enthusiasm lost in the moment
But I remember well the years and I hope they've
Been good to you as you now stand in your prime

I wonder who told you that you are greatly loved
I keep thinking back to when you said that to me
Especially when I'm at loggerheads with my future
Disappointed that those good old dreams aren't nearer

16 years you were a very special person to me
Why did you never think to draw me aside ask
Me to share the things I know about this Pale Blue
Dot. Where the God's themselves come to grow
