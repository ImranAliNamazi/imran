<a href="../affirmations1/">Last year</a> I prayed that you be strong and resilient
With no quit in you, unbreakable like adamantine
Strength you draw from your parents who went
That extra mile to see you siblings pure and pristine

For your friends we wanted the bonds to ever deepen
As you each faced your daemons but shared the load
You share your ups and downs - memories they sweeten
As you joyously journey carefree upon life's open road

Work does worry you sometimes but your team is swell
You let the worry impel you to focus and be streamlined
Another happy client so often, elated they ring the bell
And you feel so pleased you've excelled as they find

Your one of the best at what you do, IP Law in Chennai
With needs so simple as to make a renunciate blush
All you want is for your family to flourish, they will - aye!
You daughter is sweet, I hope her generation can crush

The seeds of disharmony and inequality that abounds
On Mother Earth on whose tender face peace reigns
Shanthi - a peace that pervades as we do the rounds
Wondering how soon we will be liberated of our pains
