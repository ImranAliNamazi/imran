It had been one long holiday of loving after the other
Each time I thought this is it - she I'll have for tether
The days would wear on and no hand would seek mine
Now I hope finally the sparks will bathe us like sunshine

It's funny I say "us" when truly there is noone there
Time to open up my eyes and turn the page - where
Will I find a girl to cross the river with, can I swim
It seems I dunno how, and my chances wear thin

With each passing year, a man beyond his prime
With shattered dreams who'se worn so by time
Will I find a way out into nature and be buoyed
Maybe time washes my cares and I'm overjoyed

That I still have some dreams left to hold onto
But the million dollar question - is there a girl to
Push me to the brink of what I am capable of?
And be pushed in turn till we discover what stuff

Makes us - let the steel twang to a soulful tune
And let sparks fly from us out under the moon
And keep showering us tenderly until sunup
Making love and thinking of you, buttercup
