It was a pleasant evening I suppose
We took photos, each struck a pose
Around the farm we did go
Taking the vibes in nice and slow

The trees are fully in bloom
Filling the air with Nature's perfume
We had dinner around eight
And now we're feeling satiate

On the cycle I go
Under the sky, indigo
We stopped by and saw a cow,
 said bye to her for now

We're sitting in the shed
Ready to hit the bed
For we are tired beyond belief
Our hearts lighter, we sigh with relief

After our prayer,
We met a farmer
Now that we've lightened our load
We're ready to hit the road
