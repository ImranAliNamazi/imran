They do say that Spirit transforms Matter, so be kind
In time you will find, above it all, rules our very own mind
What Spirit do I speak of, is it the Paramatma in the sky?
No, I say it is the Jivatma which animates you and I

How does this transformation begin? I'm not so sure
I just know we have to try harder than we did before
Some says it's like a fountain springing from the heart
Some say the wise show it with paint or other art

<strong>Some say the divine sparks so fiery when we fashion
Delightful things with our hands, filled with passion
Passion that's bristling beneath can certainly push us
To build better things that serve the Lord, do not fuss</strong>

About the way in which you offer yourself to Him
Rather remember we're guided by his lamp not dim
A thousand splendid suns show their way when we give
Ourselves completely to love, so learn to forgive

It is indeed mind over matter so cleanse your mind
Bathe it in Amrit or Ambrosia, so that ye may find
A glimpse of divinity in all that you undertake to do
Then your lowliest moods will still have a special hue
