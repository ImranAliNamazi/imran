Sincerity is a grace from above, alongside humility
Remember the story of the tortoise and the hare
The tortoise sincerely gave his best, wasn't uppity
And won with his steady toil and dedication where

Most of us instead want instant gratification and believe
We are entitled to this or that luxury. Love sincerely and
The Kingdom of heaven is yours, wear heart on sleeve
And the ones that appreciate honesty will join your band

Toil long and hard for your dreams and they will come
But you must have faith and a force of conviction guiding 
Your actions. Toil hard giving no thought to the outcome
And just when your faith is flagging, an angel appearing

Out of nowhere will give you a boost and you the pinnacle
Will surmount, for those who are sincere will always get
What they work for. Toil and always improve your skill
For much importance is give to how we grow as we let

Confidence and abilities improve with each passing day
As this poem draws to a close, think to love sincerely
Every last person or animal that help us along the way
As we laugh and cry, living life, yearning to be free
