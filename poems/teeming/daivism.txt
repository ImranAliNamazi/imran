<!--TODO: rename as [dance the divine] ball -->

Yesterday we were unto one another, totally unknown.
Today, what shared ambitions? What seeds unsown?
It's time to bring back the forms of the very Gods
That walked this Earth, ruled not by fists or rods.

But by a loving radiance that engulfs space itself.
Wonder we do - can we live Life Divine by ourself?
Not wholly by ourselves for we're inextricably linked.
A day of Brahma passed, Lord Vishnu just blinked!

The ages wear on - we're reminded of a time it was Dwapara
Where are we headed? And how to gain poise over this Samsara?
It's not all illusions - the love and wisdom are for real.
Life is what you make, so give it your utmost and feel

One with the Loving Universe that birthed us all.
Let's live the Daivic Cycle, dance the Divine Ball!
When we try and measure the distance between the stars,
Do we forget He who holds them in His hand, hums bars,

Waiting for his hum to overtake the center of our being.
Live Dearly, Love Often, Laugh Much, enjoy everything -
Let the Rasa or taste of pleasure or pain not bind you.
Every second, be so content that you can easily bid adieu.
