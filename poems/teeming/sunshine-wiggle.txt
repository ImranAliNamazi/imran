Dalgona coffee was named after the Korean sugar it resembles
I'm told it sends tingling feelings all over the one who drinks it
If I could have it ever so often, I would better face my troubles
It would leave me awake into the night, reading by lamp pale lit

On the beach too I would read, in fact in each waking moment
I appreciate good coffee and also books with woven thought
I let my emotions play out, I feel each joy, then crash and vent
Like they say, a spoonful of sugar helps hold us up in drought


With family I am now, no longer a young lad reading on a beach
A mighty young man they call me, though sometimes I'm smote
And pushed to the brink instead of Heaven for which I reach
Strong am I for the wife I espoused and the kids upon who I dote

Turtles I see, frolicking on the sand, how they love their young
We're oft times saddened by the sombre tone of this world
With delinquents that drive us to insane actions, oh how stung
We are by all the bitterness and conflict instead of letting unfurl

Our banners that could be crowned by seahorses and unicorns
Out in the sunshine let's let go of our every care and nutty niggle
As we say goodnight then watch as they disappear before the morns
Dance and sing at the joy that is life, do the Sunshine Wiggle
