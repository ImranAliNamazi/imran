[Poet]

I hope you remember Monty, he guided me in my youth
A sheep I'm extremely fond of, who was uncommon wise
Now I wonder was that past all a dream? Why so uncouth 
Must be the days, fearful as we wonder at so many whys

[Sophie]

Why did this or other happen, why a life of scarcity when I
Just yesterday dreamed of the stars for myself and baby
And we were almost there, now those days make me cry
As I think I must hold on to my sanity, though I'm not free

[Poet]

<strong>We never know why we are tested a certain way my dear
Something of what we must learn as we lead a full life
Don't let the past weigh on you, focus and get into gear
No matter how painful, for we need strength to fight strife</strong>

[Sophie]
I was frail for a while, but beneath the scars is a rage
I may seem caged now but my song rings far and true
It's a song of many who without hope have left the stage
But that shan't be my fate I fight for the best for us two

I have met lovely people over the years and I see strength
In those who kept fighting hard for ones who they love
My tale won't be of woe by the time I cross it's full length
Tell Monty don't cry, I'm healed - time to fly like a dove
