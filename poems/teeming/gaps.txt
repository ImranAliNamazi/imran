There's gaps in the attention we get from parents when we grow up
There's intellectual chasms and bridges to cross, we're shut up
And left with our brooding thoughts with no one giving direction
Oh how I could live in joy and peace, inspired by this vedic civilization

She baffles us all with her wealth of experience and wisdom
With no set path to follow, we're left to execute a total freedom
Our new generation has many questions and are left to discover
Spiritual development oft left in our hands, we wobble and quiver

Confusion grows as we begin to work, we forget the basics
The routine and the middle path - whole hearted fun and frolics
The fast-pacedness of the world sometimes leaves us reeling
We rarely find our own voice and go about life gleefully singing

With pressure on us, we marry thinking things'll get sorted out
But the firm basis of a long term relationship is missed and we shout
In frustration, for our partner is on such a different wavelength
Remember we're shorn from our parents too, so who gives strength

We babble and plead to this friend and that to save us from hell
We're stuck in neutral and everyone seems to do so bloody well
It's all a facade we millennials remain for the most part clueless
But under the surface we CARE so our burdens seem a tad less
