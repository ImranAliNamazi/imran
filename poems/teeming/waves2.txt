Waves of memories come and go, my earliest are with you
Appa, have you taken birth yet or need I pray for you in limbo?
Those waves carried me to our monthly dinners with family
Shyam, Venka, You, Vichu, Me and Advaith ga ga over  food

<strong>Had I known then how many short years we had left, I'da calmed down
Instead of shouting at a father whose done his best for me, his son
There's memories of conversations and drives but YOU I miss
Can't you come back and kiss me gently and put your arms around mine</strong>

Now I begin to glimpse at the pain that good children go through
When they lose both parents, a constant sob dwells inside
Shyam tried telling me a good 10 years to be a better son to you
But it wasn't in our nature to let quietly time go by, we had to argue

What about and why, I no longer know. I do miss your smile
Leaves a vacuum in my heart as new waves crash over me
I've been a distant and mean cuss for most of my adult life
I must remember to help others bridge the gap with their parents

I'm not even that good at looking after my mother, I despair and cry
When I think of all the pain I've caused you two over the years
I'm a bundle of raw emotions, I hope both your prayers are answered
That some sweet girl will help me make sense of what I meant to you
