I've known you now for 5 years and dote on you
Your home is the most tranquil place I've been to
One whole year you stood and comforted my soul
My turn to pray hard as you watch your dreams unfurl

The sword of time may pierce the skin for most of us
But your poise increases with the passage of years
Your faith unshakeable, I know that your submission
To the Lord's will keeps you steadfast on your mission

To touch the lives of the loved ones that surround you
As to each of us you share a fragrance, a word, a hue
One day soon, I'll bring my children for lunch at 12
I'm sure their hearts would lift to hear from your well

Of experience, embellished by the memory of Mahatmas
Gone, who've uncovered for you the uttamam rahasyam
<strong>The secret of life that brings us peace and courage
Do inspire them powerfully, weave a spell - for the age

We're living in requires strong and grounded youngsters
Strong as whipcord, who'll take to task these fraudsters</strong>
Who've controlled us enough - let the winds of change
Blow - as Universal Harmony we no longer find strange
