I mean to say I am one with the Earth's Spirit
I know when a Sparrow falls - I fall with it
When a million souls pass, I pave their way
Lovely they were, and missed much today

But tomorrow they'll be reborn as a new race
As we reach forward and touch Earth's face
For now just cry, you've lost someone special
Think of your shared youth, draw from a well

A stream of hope and joy that we partake of
As we strive to build more beautiful stuff
Why cry when the pain is so real and hurts
Look to the uniting wave of love that spurts

<strong>Boundless our joy if we but peek beyond the veil
And see that there is no loss, no distance, swell
Can be the time when reunited we are again
So lift your flagging spirits, dont let it know pain</strong>

Dear Aunt, mankind marches to a sombre beat
It's not easy I know to feel its every pain or feat
I just hope there's mending for your soul
As times come by and makes you feel whole
