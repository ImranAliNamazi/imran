When we visit a farm, the beauty of Nature we get to see
It causes our pulse to quicken, sky gazing oh so lazily
The calls of birds weave their bright magic upon our soul
The city couldn't mend us, but now, out here we're whole

I saw butterflies this morning, reminded me how small
Is a jivatma (individuated life) - then saw a tree so tall
Did he that made the creator of the concrete jungle
Make all this beauty here? Why do we follow the Devil

Into his lair, thinking we can despoil nature for petty gain
I'm am with the birds and wind. That mellifluous refrain
Fills my heart with the memories of my youth in the city
When I wished to have a farm and till the soil so gently

But my work carries me to the city, you see I lead 2 lives
I tire of technology and the way its used to cut like knives
I'd much rather we grow up and learn to give constantly
I guess we need to salvage quality after this malady

I am thankful to my hosts for bringing me here to Eden
That I dreamt of a short month ago whilst in a garden
I dream that some day, Niggle's parish will run wild
Across the worlds, for then, He truly would us guide
