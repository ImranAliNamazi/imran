Online classes and studying from home will in time prove
That teachers are indeed a boon, and that parents can learn
To not only home educate but also their child's learning to improve
Until the child learns to fend for him/herself, finding ways to earn

The technology isn't quite all there yet but now there's fierce
Competition out there to find the right balance of tech and soul
The soul of a teacher, her gentle loving gaze that can pierce
To the depths of a child, make them think, say, act and be whole

I hope this pandemic causes educators with the wrong motive
To just give up and find something else that is their calling
While the ones that love how they can shape a kid, help them live
A life inspired, stubborn to find meaning and not keep falling

Down at the least pressure that life throws at them, to stay
The course, be strong until the finish, for that was our wish
As guides, that they keep pursuing until dreams held sway
And beat all the odds, sumptuously cooking their own dish

Online Education has shaken the very roots of our notions
There's plenty of scope for improvement no doubt but know this
That it will stop us all from just going through the motions
Instead grind us all until we've made our kid's life into bliss
