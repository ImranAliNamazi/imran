I remember the wind blowing wildly through my phone
When you made sweet love to me with that velvet voice
When the wings of my heart would lift me airborne
What memories of your grin framing that gentle poise

I remember we walked together into a castle
How the icy winds blew us into the other's arms
How we built a fire and let it blaze and crackle
How I'd love to make love / weather the storms

We would glide out on slender oars just down river
No winds blowing, no sails to cast in the dark
Just the rhythm as we pulled in tandem, aquiver
Was my mind as I drew you close with a teary spark

You got your feelings, you got desires that I take you
And the whispering wind blows a mournful song
It's one of those nights, with flaws so very few
Come here dearie and stay in my arms forever long

Will our paper children reach out and cherish our love
Or will we find that's all blown to tasteless refrains
I think the latter as I get ready to leave this duo's cove
With memories so painful I'd wanna blow out my brains
