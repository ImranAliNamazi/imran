<strong>Time draws to a standstill for one who fills each demanding
Minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run, we're searching
For answers to the riddle of this world, all it asks is our poise
Total and absolute amidst the bustle, the uproar and the noise</strong>

Nishkama karma is the attitude that poise is the outcome of
Action without thought for its reward, for its own sake - stuff
You'd do even if no one was looking. Doing what your nature
Demands, as you learn to be kind to people of every stature

Some say time - the thief, robs us of our youth and loved ones
Masters say submit to her and she'll dawn like a 1000 suns
Alan Parsons says time, she flows like a river, beckoning us all
We learn to fathom her depths, meet our limitations yet stand tall

The Pink Floyd Sound said that at first it seems that you Are
young and life is long and there is time to steal, but beware
In an instant a decade has flown past and we are left brooding
25 years has passed since I heard that song, I'm still waiting

For that one moment in time when I will feel eternity, be a winner
Dance upon verdant meadows, be unlike the condemned sinner
Who thinks he has lost time to make up for, whereas he only
Need to be at peace with himself for then each second is lovely
