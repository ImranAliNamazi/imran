Dearest friend mine, I love the way you show care
For yourself, above all because you are especial
I worry about you sometimes, hope I can be there
In some small way, while you do your best to be well

I see you boldly going about giving your best
So that your son can grow up and find joy in life
Be loving for that is the way to give yourself rest
Amidst the bustle, to find contentment amidst the strife

I'm a fine one to advise you for I flit and flit
About, wondering when will be my turn to serve with joy
I rejoice to see you happy, show some of that wit
That makes us all smile, I wish good for your boy

I'm aware of the upheavals your are going through
Caring for and serving parents is a privilege
You are already prayerful, so continue being you,
peaceful and loving - being a fountainhead, at the edge 

The edge of where we take a decision to evolve
Becoming a channel for the divine music to play
I know you dear friend, help us this riddle to solve
When life becomes hallowed, and good thoughts hold sway
